= Rake 0.4.15 Released

== Changes

Version 0.4.15 is a bug fix update for the Ruby 1.8.2 compatibility
changes.  This release includes:

* Fixed a bug that prevented the TESTOPTS flag from working with the
  revised for 1.8.2 test task.

* Updated the docs on --trace to indicate that it also enables a full
  backtrace on errors.

* Several fixes for new warnings generated.

== Mini-Roadmap

I will continue to issue Rake updates in the 0.4.xx series as new
Ruby-1.8.2 issues become manifest.  Once the codebase stabilizes, I
will release a 0.5.0 version incorporating all the changes.  If you
are not using Ruby-1.8.2 and wish to avoid version churn, I recommend
staying with a release prior to Rake-0.4.14.

== What is Rake

Rake is a build tool similar to the make program in many ways.  But
instead of cryptic make recipes, Rake uses standard Ruby code to
declare tasks and dependencies.  You have the full power of a modern
scripting language built right into your build tool.
