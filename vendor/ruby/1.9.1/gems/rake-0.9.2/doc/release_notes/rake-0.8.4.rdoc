= Rake 0.8.4 Released

Rake version 0.8.4 is a bug-fix release of rake.

NOTE: The version of Rake that comes with Ruby 1.9 has diverged
      slightly from the core Rake code base.  Rake 0.8.4 will work
      with Ruby 1.9, but is not a strict upgrade for the Rake that
      comes with Ruby 1.9.  A (near) future release of Rake will unify
      those two codebases.

== Letter Writing Campaign

Thanks to Aaron Patterson (@tenderlove) and Eric Hodel (@drbrain) for
their encouraging support in organizing a letter writing campaign to
lobby for the "Warning Free" release of rake 0.8.4.  A special callout
goes to Jonathan D. Lord, Sr (Dr. Wingnut) whose postcard was the
first to actually reach me. (see
http://tenderlovemaking.com/2009/02/26/we-need-a-new-version-of-rake/
for details)

== What is Rake

Rake is a build tool similar to the make program in many ways. But
instead of cryptic make recipes, Rake uses standard Ruby code to
declare tasks and dependencies. You have the full power of a modern
scripting language built right into your build tool.

== Availability

The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems ...

  gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)

Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:

Home Page:: http://rake.rubyforge.org/
Download::  http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50
GitHub::    git://github.com/jimweirich/rake.git

== Task Argument Examples

Prior to version 0.8.0, rake was only able to handle command line
arguments of the form NAME=VALUE that were passed into Rake via the
ENV hash.  Many folks had asked for some kind of simple command line
arguments, perhaps using "--" to separate regular task names from
argument values on the command line.  The problem is that there was no
easy way to associate positional arguments on the command line with
different tasks.  Suppose both tasks :a and :b expect a command line
argument: does the first value go with :a?  What if :b is run first?
Should it then get the first command line argument.

Rake 0.8.0 solves this problem by explicitly passing values directly
to the tasks that need them.  For example, if I had a release task
that required a version number, I could say:

   rake release[0.8.4]

And the string "0.8.4" will be passed to the :release task.  Multiple
arguments can be passed by separating them with a comma, for example:

   rake name[john,doe]

Just a few words of caution.  The rake task name and its arguments
need to be a single command line argument to rake.  This generally
means no spaces.  If spaces are needed, then the entire rake +
argument string should be quoted.  Something like this:

   rake "name[billy bob, smith]"

(Quoting rules vary between operating systems and shells, so make sure
you consult the proper docs for your OS/shell).

=== Tasks that Expect Parameters

Parameters are only given to tasks that are setup to expect them.  In
order to handle named parameters, the task declaration syntax for
tasks has been extended slightly.

For example, a task that needs a first name and last name might be
declared as:

   task :name, :first_name, :last_name

The first argument is still the name of the task (:name in this case).
The next to argumements are the names of the parameters expected by
:name (:first_name and :last_name in the example).

To access the values of the paramters, the block defining the task
behaviour can now accept a second parameter:

   task :name, :first_name, :last_name do |t, args|
     puts "First name is #{args.first_name}"
     puts "Last  name is #{args.last_name}"
   end

The first argument of the block "t" is always bound to the current
task object.  The second argument "args" is an open-struct like object
that allows access to the task arguments.  Extra command line
arguments to a task are ignored.  Missing command line arguments are
given the nil value.
