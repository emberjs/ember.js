= Rake 0.7.3 Released

Rake version 0.7.3 is a minor release that includes some refactoring to better
support custom Rake applications.

== Changes

=== New Features in Version 0.7.3

* Added the +init+ and +top_level+ methods to make the creation of custom Rake applications a bit easier.  E.g.

    gem 'rake', ">= 0.7.3"
    require 'rake'

    Rake.application.init('myrake')

    task :default do
      something_interesting
    end

    Rake.application.top_level

== What is Rake

Rake is a build tool similar to the make program in many ways. But instead of
cryptic make recipes, Rake uses standard Ruby code to declare tasks and
dependencies. You have the full power of a modern scripting language built
right into your build tool.

== Availability

The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems ...

  gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)

Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:

Home Page:: http://rake.rubyforge.org/
Download::  http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50

== Thanks

As usual, it was input from users that drove a alot of these changes. The
following people either contributed patches, made suggestions or made
otherwise helpful comments. Thanks to ...
