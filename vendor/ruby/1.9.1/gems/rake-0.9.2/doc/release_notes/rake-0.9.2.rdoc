= Rake 0.9.2 Released

Rake version 0.9.2 has a few small fixes.  See below for details.

== Changes

* Support for Ruby 1.8.6 was fixed.
* Global DSL warnings now honor --no-deprecate

== What is Rake

Rake is a build tool similar to the make program in many ways. But
instead of cryptic make recipes, Rake uses standard Ruby code to
declare tasks and dependencies. You have the full power of a modern
scripting language built right into your build tool.

== Availability

The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems ...

  gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)

Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:

Home Page:: http://rake.rubyforge.org/
Download::  http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50
GitHub::    git://github.com/jimweirich/rake.git

== Thanks

following people either contributed patches, made suggestions or made
otherwise helpful comments.  Thanks to ...

Also, bit thanks to Eric Hodel for assisting with getting this release
out the door (where "assisting" includes, but is not by any means
limited to, "pushing" me to get it done).
