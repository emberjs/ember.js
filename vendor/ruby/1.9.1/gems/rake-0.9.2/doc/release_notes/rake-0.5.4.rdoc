= Rake 0.5.4 Released

Time for some minor bug fixes and small enhancements

== Changes

Here are the changes for version 0.5.3 ...

* Added double quotes to the test runner.  This allows the location of
  the tests (and runner) to be in a directory path that contains
  spaces (e.g. "C:/Program Files/ruby/bin").

* Added .svn to default ignore list.  Now subversion project metadata
  is automatically ignored by Rake's FileList.

* Updated FileList#include to support nested arrays and filelists.
  FileLists are flat lists of file names.  Using a FileList in an
  include will flatten out the nested file names.

== What is Rake

Rake is a build tool similar to the make program in many ways.  But
instead of cryptic make recipes, Rake uses standard Ruby code to
declare tasks and dependencies.  You have the full power of a modern
scripting language built right into your build tool.

== Availability

The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems ...

  gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)

Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:

Home Page:: http://rake.rubyforge.org/
Download::  http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50

== Thanks

As usual, it was input from users that drove a alot of these changes.
Thanks to ...

* Tilman Sauerbeck for the nested FileList suggestion.
* Josh Knowles for pointing out the spaces in directory name problem.
