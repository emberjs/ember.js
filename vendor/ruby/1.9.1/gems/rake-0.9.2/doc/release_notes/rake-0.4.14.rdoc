= Rake 0.4.14 Released

== Changes

Version 0.4.14 is a compatibility fix to allow Rake's test task to
work under Ruby 1.8.2.  A change in the Test::Unit autorun feature
prevented Rake from running any tests.  This release fixes the
problem.

Rake 0.4.14 is the recommended release for anyone using Ruby 1.8.2.

== What is Rake

Rake is a build tool similar to the make program in many ways.  But
instead of cryptic make recipes, Rake uses standard Ruby code to
declare tasks and dependencies.  You have the full power of a modern
scripting language built right into your build tool.
