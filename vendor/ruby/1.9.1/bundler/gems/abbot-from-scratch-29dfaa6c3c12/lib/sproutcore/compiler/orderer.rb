    # The purpose of this class is to create a sorting algorithm that approximates
    # Ruby's require algorithm.
    #
    # It works by adding entries in the order they were added, but adding
    # dependencies first (also in the order they were specified). Once an entry 
    # has been added, it will not be added again.
    #
    # This allows for "circular" dependencies, where two files both need to
    # exist, but their order doesn't matter. This is a case where neither entry
    # technically depends on the other one, but the full expected functionality
    # requires both entries.
