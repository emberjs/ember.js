### 1.10.0 (February 7, 2015)

* [BUGFIX] Ensure that property case is normalized.
* [BUGFIX] Prevent an error from being thrown if the errorThrown property is a string when catching unhandled promise rejections.
* [BUGFIX] `contenteditable` elements should fire focus events in `ember-testing` click helper.
* [BUGFIX] Remove HTMLBars from builds `ember.debug.js` and `ember.prod.js` builds. Please see https://emberjs.com/blog/2015/02/05/compiling-templates-in-1-10-0.html for more details.
* [BUGFIX] Ensure that calling the `wait` testing helper without routing works properly.
* [BUGFIX] Ensure that a plus sign in query params are treated as spaces.
* [BUGFIX] Fix broken `Ember.Test.unregisterWaiter` semantics.
* [BUGFIX] Allow unbound helpers to add attributes.
* [BUGFIX] Ensure compat helpers calling `options.fn` work.
* [BUGFIX] Fix memory leak in view streams.
* [BUGFIX] Don't render default layout for `Ember.TextField`.
* Update HTMLBars version to v0.8.5:
  * Allow numbers to be parsed as HTML in IE.

  * Include line number in error thrown for unclosed HTML element.
  * `removeAttribute` fix for IE <11 and SVG.
  * Disable `cloneNodes` in IE8.
  * Improve HTML validation and error messages thrown.
  * Fix a number of template compilation issues in IE8.
  * Use the correct namespace in `parseHTML` (fixes various issues that occur
    when changing to and from alternate namespaces).
  * Ensure values are converted to `String`'s when setting attributes (fixes issues in IE10 & IE11).
  * Change `setProperty` and `morph` to remove an `undefined` attr value.
* Remove dots from default resolver descriptions.
* Add helpful assertion if a block helper is not found.
* Make Ember.HTMLBars version of registerHelper private.
* [BUGFIX] Add `options.types` and `options.hashTypes` for Handlebars compatible helpers.
* [BUGFIX] Fix usage of `emptyView` with `{{#each}}` helper.
* Assert if an attribute set statically and via bind-attr.  For example:
  `<div class="foo" {{bind-attr class="bar"}}></div>` will now trigger an assertion (instead of
  silently failing).
* [BUGFIX] Fix deprecated bindAttr helper.
* [BUGFIX] Do not allow both keyword and block params.
* Cleanup HTMLBars public API
  * Remove `Ember.HTMLBars.helper`.
  * Remove internal `registerBoundHelper` function (use
    `registerHelper('blah', makeViewHelper(SomeView))` or `registerHelper('blah', makeBoundHelper(func))`).
* [BUGFIX] Fix Handlebars compat mode `registerHelper` interop with `makeViewHelper`.
* [BUGFIX] Ensure that `mergedProperties` are properly merged when all properties are not present.
* Add options argument to pass url to `Ember.deprecate`.

* [BUGFIX] Allow compat makeBoundHelpers to be sub-expressions.
* [BUGFIX] Export Ember.Handlebars compat shim for `Ember.Handlebars.SafeString` and `Ember.Handlebars.Utils.escapeExpression`.
* [BUGFIX] Allow `Ember.inject` injected properties to be overridden (makes testing significantly easier).
* [BUGFIX] Don’t assert uncaught RSVP rejections. We are already logging the error, but asserting breaks everything else on the run loop queue.
* [BUGFIX] Allow tagName to be a CP (with deprecation).
* [BUGFIX] Allow view instances in {{view}}.
* [BUGFIX] Ensure bound attrs flush immediately.
* [PERFORMANCE] Initialize views in preRender state.
* [PERFORMANCE] `View#element` should not be observable.
* Add ember-template-compiler package.
* Rename `Ember.HTMLBars.registerASTPlugin` to `Ember.HTMLBars.registerPlugin`.
* Export `ember-template-compiler.js`.
* Escape `href`, `src`, and `background` attributes for `a`, `link`, `img`, and `iframe` elements.
* Move debugging file output from `ember.js` to `ember.debug.js`.
* Remove `templateData` property from views.

### 1.9.1 (December 23, 2014)

* Allow `{{view}}` helper to properly handle view instances.
* Escape `href`, `src`, and `background` attributes for `a`, `link`, `img`, and `iframe` elements.

### 1.9.0 (December 8, 2014)

* Add deprecation for quoteless outlet names (`{{outlet main}}` should be `{{outlet 'main'}}`).
* [BUGFIX] Update the `Ember.Map#forEach` callback to include the map being iterated over.
* [BUGFIX] Ensure that tagless container views are rendered properly.
* [PERF] `Ember.View#_outlets` is no longer observable.
* [PERF] Avoid extending a view for every `{{each}}`.
* Ensure initializers have a `name` property (provides a helpful assertion if missing).
* [BUILD TOOLING] Enable easier cross-browser testing by publishing builds and tests to S3.
* Enable `Ember.run.join` to return a value even if within an existing run loop.
* Update `Ember.EventDispatcher` to use `Ember.run.join`. This is required so that synchronous
  events (like focus) do not spawn a nested run loop.
* Deprecate context switching form of {{each}}.
* Deprecate context switching form of {{with}}.
* Add improved error message when a component lookup fails.
* Ensure that component actions that are subscribed to, trigger an assertion when unhandled. Consider the following example:

```handlebars
{{!component-a.hbs}}

{{some-other-component action="saveMe"}}
```

Clearly, `component-a` has subscribed to `some-other-component`'s `action`. Previously, if `component-a` did not handle the action, it would silently continue.  Now, an assertion would be triggered.

* [PERF] Speedup Mixin creation.
