SproutCore Bootstrap

The bootstrap framework contains several basic elements needed to load 
SproutCore applications including browser detection and module loading.  By
default the SproutCore build system will load the bootstrap framework as an 
inline JavaScript at the top of the page.

When building SproutCore Mini, the bootstrap framework is also the first bit
of code included in the build.
