// FormsEditMode propagates the 'isEditing' property to its child view.
// It is simple enough that we can test it super-cleanly: mix it into
// an object, provide an array 'childViews' containing other objects,
// and match.
//
// Things to test:
//
// - Basic: isEditing defaults to NO, hasEditMode is YES; these are sanity checks.
// - Changing isEditing propagates to children.
//

  // this default is good to check, as it is just the kind of thing
  // someone would change when trying to fix a different bug--for instance,
  // if FormView stopped properly initializing in edit mode.
