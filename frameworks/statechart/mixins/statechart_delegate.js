    The statechart and states remain completely independent of how the underlying 
    routing mechanism works thereby providing a looser coupling and more flexibility 
    in how routing is to work. Given this flexiblity, it is important that a route
    assigned (using the {@link SC.State#representRoute} property) to a state strictly 
    conforms to the underlying routing mechanism's criteria in order for the given 
    handler to be properly invoked.
    
    By default the {@link SC.routes} mechanism is used to bind the state's handler with
    the given route.
    
    @param {SC.StatechartManager} statechart the statechart
    @param {SC.State} state the state to bind the route to
