  @namespace

  This is the default InlineEditorDelegate for SC.LabelView. The default editor
  is an SC.InlineTextFieldView.

  Only one editor is allowed to be active at a time. If another view requests an
  editor while an editor is already active, the delegate will first attempt to
  commit the existing editor, then discard it if commit fails, and fail to
  acquire if the active editor could not be discarded.

  Each time an editor is required, it instantiates it and appends it to the same
  parentView as the view being edited. The editor is responsible for positioning
  itself correctly in its beginEditing method.

    If an editor is currently active, dismisses it by first attempting to commit
    and if that fails attempting to dismiss. If that fails, the acquire fails
    and returns null.

    Otherwise, it creates the editor as a child of the client view's parentView
    and returns it.

    The default editor is an SC.InlineTextFieldView. The client view may
    customize this by setting a different inlineEditor as its exampleEditor
    property.
