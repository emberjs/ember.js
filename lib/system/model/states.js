/**
  This file encapsulates the various states that a record can transition
  through during its lifecycle.

  ### State Manager

  A record's state manager explicitly tracks what state a record is in
  at any given time. For instance, if a record is newly created and has
  not yet been sent to the adapter to be saved, it would be in the
  `created.uncommitted` state.  If a record has had local modifications
  made to it that are in the process of being saved, the record would be
  in the `updated.inFlight` state. (These state paths will be explained
  in more detail below.)

  Events are sent by the record or its store to the record's state manager.
  How the state manager reacts to these events is dependent on which state
  it is in. In some states, certain events will be invalid and will cause
  an exception to be raised.

  States are hierarchical. For example, a record can be in the
  `deleted.start` state, then transition into the `deleted.inFlight` state.
  If a child state does not implement an event handler, the state manager
  will attempt to invoke the event on all parent states until the root state is
  reached. The state hierarchy of a record is described in terms of a path
  string. You can determine a record's current state by getting its manager's
  current state path:

        record.getPath('stateManager.currentState.path');
        //=> "created.uncommitted"

  The `DS.Model` states are themselves stateless. What we mean is that,
  though each instance of a record also has a unique instance of a
  `DS.StateManager`, the hierarchical states that each of *those* points
  to is a shared data structure. For performance reasons, instead of each
  record getting its own copy of the hierarchy of states, each state
  manager points to this global, immutable shared instance. How does a
  state know which record it should be acting on?  We pass a reference to
  the current state manager as the first parameter to every method invoked
  on a state.

  The state manager passed as the first parameter is where you should stash
  state about the record if needed; you should never store data on the state
  object itself. If you need access to the record being acted on, you can
  retrieve the state manager's `record` property. For example, if you had
  an event handler `myEvent`:

      myEvent: function(manager) {
        var record = manager.get('record');
        record.doSomething();
      }

  For more information about state managers in general, see the Ember.js
  documentation on `Ember.StateManager`.

  ### Events, Flags, and Transitions

  A state may implement zero or more events, flags, or transitions.

  #### Events

  Events are named functions that are invoked when sent to a record. The
  state manager will first look for a method with the given name on the
  current state. If no method is found, it will search the current state's
  parent, and then its grandparent, and so on until reaching the top of
  the hierarchy. If the root is reached without an event handler being found,
  an exception will be raised. This can be very helpful when debugging new
  features.

  Here's an example implementation of a state with a `myEvent` event handler:

      aState: DS.State.create({
        myEvent: function(manager, param) {
          console.log("Received myEvent with "+param);
        }
      })

  To trigger this event:

      record.send('myEvent', 'foo');
      //=> "Received myEvent with foo"

  Note that an optional parameter can be sent to a record's `send()` method,
  which will be passed as the second parameter to the event handler.

  Events should transition to a different state if appropriate. This can be
  done by calling the state manager's `goToState()` method with a path to the
  desired state. The state manager will attempt to resolve the state path
  relative to the current state. If no state is found at that path, it will
  attempt to resolve it relative to the current state's parent, and then its
  parent, and so on until the root is reached. For example, imagine a hierarchy
  like this:

      * created
        * start <-- currentState
        * inFlight
      * updated
        * inFlight

  If we are currently in the `start` state, calling
  `goToState('inFlight')` would transition to the `created.inFlight` state,
  while calling `goToState('updated.inFlight')` would transition to
  the `updated.inFlight` state.

  Remember that *only events* should ever cause a state transition. You should
  never call `goToState()` from outside a state's event handler. If you are
  tempted to do so, create a new event and send that to the state manager.

  #### Flags

  Flags are Boolean values that can be used to introspect a record's current
  state in a more user-friendly way than examining its state path. For example,
  instead of doing this:

      var statePath = record.getPath('stateManager.currentState.path');
      if (statePath === 'created.inFlight') {
        doSomething();
      }

  You can say:

      if (record.get('isNew') && record.get('isSaving')) {
        doSomething();
      }

  If your state does not set a value for a given flag, the value will
  be inherited from its parent (or the first place in the state hierarchy
  where it is defined).

  The current set of flags are defined below. If you want to add a new flag,
  in addition to the area below, you will also need to declare it in the
  `DS.Model` class.

  #### Transitions

  Transitions are like event handlers but are called automatically upon
  entering or exiting a state. To implement a transition, just call a method
  either `enter` or `exit`:

      myState: DS.State.create({
        // Gets called automatically when entering
        // this state.
        enter: function(manager) {
          console.log("Entered myState");
        }
      })

   Note that enter and exit events are called once per transition. If the
   current state changes, but changes to another child state of the parent,
   the transition event on the parent will not be triggered.

// Implementation notes:
//
// Each state has a boolean value for all of the following flags:
//
// * isLoaded: The record has a populated `data` property. When a
//   record is loaded via `store.find`, `isLoaded` is false
//   until the adapter sets it. When a record is created locally,
//   its `isLoaded` property is always true.
// * isDirty: The record has local changes that have not yet been
//   saved by the adapter. This includes records that have been
//   created (but not yet saved) or deleted.
// * isSaving: The record's transaction has been committed, but
//   the adapter has not yet acknowledged that the changes have
//   been persisted to the backend.
// * isDeleted: The record was marked for deletion. When `isDeleted`
//   is true and `isDirty` is true, the record is deleted locally
//   but the deletion was not yet persisted. When `isSaving` is
//   true, the change is in-flight. When both `isDirty` and
//   `isSaving` are false, the change has persisted.
// * isError: The adapter reported that it was unable to save
//   local changes to the backend. This may also result in the
//   record having its `isValid` property become false if the
//   adapter reported that server-side validations failed.
// * isNew: The record was created on the client and the adapter
//   did not yet report that it was successfully saved.
// * isValid: No client-side validations have failed and the
//   adapter did not report any server-side validation failures.
// * isPending: A record `isPending` when it belongs to an
//   association on another record and that record has not been
//   saved. A record in this state cannot be saved because it
//   lacks a "foreign key" that will be supplied by its parent
//   association when the parent record has been created. When
//   the adapter reports that the parent has saved, the
//   `isPending` property on all children will become `false`
//   and the transaction will try to commit the records.

// sure to mix it in *after* the class definition, so its
