// Implementation notes:
//
// Each state has a boolean value for all of the following flags:
//
// * isLoaded: The record has a populated `data` property. When a
//   record is loaded via `store.find`, `isLoaded` is false
//   until the adapter sets it. When a record is created locally,
//   its `isLoaded` property is always true.
// * isDirty: The record has local changes that have not yet been
//   saved by the adapter. This includes records that have been
//   created (but not yet saved) or deleted.
// * isSaving: The record's transaction has been committed, but
//   the adapter has not yet acknowledged that the changes have
//   been persisted to the backend.
// * isDeleted: The record was marked for deletion. When `isDeleted`
//   is true and `isDirty` is true, the record is deleted locally
//   but the deletion was not yet persisted. When `isSaving` is
//   true, the change is in-flight. When both `isDirty` and
//   `isSaving` are false, the change has persisted.
// * isError: The adapter reported that it was unable to save
//   local changes to the backend. This may also result in the
//   record having its `isValid` property become false if the
//   adapter reported that server-side validations failed.
// * isNew: The record was created on the client and the adapter
//   did not yet report that it was successfully saved.
// * isValid: No client-side validations have failed and the
//   adapter did not report any server-side validation failures.
// * isPending: A record `isPending` when it belongs to an
//   association on another record and that record has not been
//   saved. A record in this state cannot be saved because it
//   lacks a "foreign key" that will be supplied by its parent
//   association when the parent record has been created. When
//   the adapter reports that the parent has saved, the
//   `isPending` property on all children will become `false`
//   and the transaction will try to commit the records.
