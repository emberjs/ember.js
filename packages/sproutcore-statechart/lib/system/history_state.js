/**
  @class

  Represents a history state that can be assigned to a SC.State object's
  initialSubstate property. 
  
  If a SC.HistoryState object is assigned to a state's initial substate, 
  then after a state is entered the statechart will refer to the history 
  state object to determine the next course of action. If the state has 
  its historyState property assigned then the that state will be entered, 
  otherwise the default state assigned to history state object will be entered.
  
  An example of how to use:
  
    stateA: SC.State.extend({
    
      initialSubstate: SC.HistoryState({
        defaultState: 'stateB'
      }),
      
      stateB: SC.State.extend({ ... }),
      
      stateC: SC.State.extend({ ... })
    
    })
