  /**
    Extends the JS Function object with the handleActions method that
    will provide more advanced action handling capabilities when constructing
    your statechart's states.

    By default, when you add a method to a state, the state will react to 
    actions that matches a method's name, like so:

    {{{

      state = SC.State.extend({

        // Will be invoked when a action named "foo" is sent to this state
        foo: function(action, sender, context) { ... }

      })

    }}}

    In some situations, it may be advantageous to use one method that can react to 
    multiple actions instead of having multiple methods that essentially all do the
    same thing. In order to set a method to handle more than one action you use
    the handleActions method which can be supplied a list of string and/or regular
    expressions. The following example demonstrates the use of handleActions:

    {{{

      state = SC.State.extend({

        actionHandlerA: function(action, sender, context) {

        }.handleActions('foo', 'bar'),

        actionHandlerB: function(action, sender, context) {

        }.handleActions(/num\d/, 'decimal')

      })

    }}}

    Whenever actions 'foo' and 'bar' are sent to the state, the method actionHandlerA
    will be invoked. When there is an action that matches the regular expression
    /num\d/ or the action is 'decimal' then actionHandlerB is invoked. In both 
    cases, the name of the action will be supplied to the action handler. 

    It should be noted that the use of regular expressions may impact performance
    since that statechart will not be able to fully optimize the action handling logic based
    on its use. Therefore the use of regular expression should be used sparingly. 

    @param {(String|RegExp)...} args

  Function.prototype.handleActions = function() {
    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
    args.unshift(this);
    return SC.handleActions.apply(SC, args);
  },

  /**
    Extends the JS Function object with the stateObserves method that will
    create a state observe handler on a given state object. 

    Use a stateObserves() instead of the common observes() method when you want a 
    state to observer changes to some property on the state itself or some other 
    object. 

    Any method on the state that has stateObserves is considered a state observe
    handler and behaves just like when you use observes() on a method, but with an
    important difference. When you apply stateObserves to a method on a state, those
    methods will be active *only* when the state is entered, otherwise those methods
    will be inactive. This removes the need for you having to explicitly call
    addObserver and removeObserver. As an example:

    {{{

      state = SC.State.extend({

        foo: null,

        user: null,

        observeHandlerA: function(target, key) {

        }.stateObserves('MyApp.someController.status'),

        observeHandlerB: function(target, key) {

        }.stateObserves('foo'),

        observeHandlerC: function(target, key) {

        }.stateObserves('.user.name', '.user.salary')

      })

    }}}

    Above, state has three state observe handlers: observeHandlerA, observeHandlerB, and
    observeHandlerC. When state is entered, the state will automatically add itself as
    an observer for all of its registered state observe handlers. Therefore when
    foo changes, observeHandlerB will be invoked, and when MyApp.someController's status
    changes then observeHandlerA will be invoked. The moment that state is exited then
    the state will automatically remove itself as an observer for all of its registered
    state observe handlers. Therefore none of the state observe handlers will be
    invoked until the next time the state is entered. 

    @param {String...} args
  */
  Function.prototype.stateObserves = function() {
    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
    args.unshift(this);
    return SC.stateObserves.apply(SC, args);
  }
}
