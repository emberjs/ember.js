  /**
    The collection of functions, keyed by name, available on this route as
    action targets.

    These functions will be invoked when a matching `{{action}}` is triggered
    from within a template and the application's current route is this route.

    Actions can also be invoked from other parts of your application via `Route#send`
    or `Controller#send`.

    The `actions` hash will inherit action handlers from
    the `actions` hash defined on extended Route parent classes
    or mixins rather than just replace the entire hash, e.g.:

    ```js
    App.CanDisplayBanner = Ember.Mixin.create({
      actions: {
        displayBanner: function(msg) {
          // ...
        }
      }
    });

    App.WelcomeRoute = Ember.Route.extend(App.CanDisplayBanner, {
      actions: {
        playMusic: function() {
          // ...
        }
      }
    });

    // `WelcomeRoute`, when active, will be able to respond
    // to both actions, since the actions hash is merged rather
    // then replaced when extending mixins / parent classes.
    this.send('displayBanner');
    this.send('playMusic');
    ```

    Within a route's action handler, the value of the `this` context
    is the Route object:

    ```js
    App.SongRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        myAction: function() {
          this.controllerFor("song");
          this.transitionTo("other.route");
          ...
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    It is also possible to call `this._super()` from within an
    action handler if it overrides a handler defined on a parent
    class or mixin:

    Take for example the following routes:

    ```js
    App.DebugRoute = Ember.Mixin.create({
      actions: {
        debugRouteInformation: function() {
          console.debug("trololo");
        }
      }
    });

    App.AnnoyingDebugRoute = Ember.Route.extend(App.DebugRoute, {
      actions: {
        debugRouteInformation: function() {
          // also call the debugRouteInformation of mixed in App.DebugRoute
          this._super();

          // show additional annoyance
          window.alert(...);
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    ## Bubbling

    By default, an action will stop bubbling once a handler defined
    on the `actions` hash handles it. To continue bubbling the action,
    you must return `true` from the handler:

    ```js
    App.Router.map(function() {
      this.resource("album", function() {
        this.route("song");
      });
    });

    App.AlbumRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        startPlaying: function() {
        }
      }
    });

    App.AlbumSongRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        startPlaying: function() {
          // ...

          if (actionShouldAlsoBeTriggeredOnParentRoute) {
            return true;
          }
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    ## Built-in actions

    There are a few built-in actions pertaining to transitions that you
    can use to customize transition behavior: `willTransition` and
    `error`.

    ### `willTransition`

    The `willTransition` action is fired at the beginning of any
    attempted transition with a `Transition` object as the sole
    argument. This action can be used for aborting, redirecting,
    or decorating the transition from the currently active routes.

    A good example is preventing navigation when a form is
    half-filled out:

    ```js
    App.ContactFormRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        willTransition: function(transition) {
          if (this.controller.get('userHasEnteredData')) {
            this.controller.displayNavigationConfirm();
            transition.abort();
          }
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    You can also redirect elsewhere by calling
    `this.transitionTo('elsewhere')` from within `willTransition`.
    Note that `willTransition` will not be fired for the
    redirecting `transitionTo`, since `willTransition` doesn't
    fire when there is already a transition underway. If you want
    subsequent `willTransition` actions to fire for the redirecting
    transition, you must first explicitly call
    `transition.abort()`.

    ### `error`

    When attempting to transition into a route, any of the hooks
    may throw an error, or return a promise that rejects, at which
    point an `error` action will be fired on the partially-entered
    routes, allowing for per-route error handling logic, or shared
    error handling logic defined on a parent route.

    Here is an example of an error handler that will be invoked
    for rejected promises / thrown errors from the various hooks
    on the route, as well as any unhandled errors from child
    routes:

    ```js
    App.AdminRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      beforeModel: function() {
        throw "bad things!";
        // ...or, equivalently:
        return Ember.RSVP.reject("bad things!");
      },

      actions: {
        error: function(error, transition) {
          // Assuming we got here due to the error in `beforeModel`,
          // we can expect that error === "bad things!",
          // but a promise model rejecting would also
          // call this hook, as would any errors encountered
          // in `afterModel`.

          // The `error` hook is also provided the failed
          // `transition`, which can be stored and later
          // `.retry()`d if desired.

          this.transitionTo('login');
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    `error` actions that bubble up all the way to `ApplicationRoute`
    will fire a default error handler that logs the error. You can
    specify your own global default error handler by overriding the
    `error` handler on `ApplicationRoute`:

    ```js
    App.ApplicationRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        error: function(error, transition) {
          this.controllerFor('banner').displayError(error.message);
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    for performing redirects after the model has resolved.

    @method redirect
    @param {Object} model the model for this route
  */
  redirect: Ember.K,

  /**
    This hook is the first of the route entry validation hooks
    called when an attempt is made to transition into a route
    or one of its children. It is called before `model` and
    `afterModel`, and is appropriate for cases when:

    1) A decision can be made to redirect elsewhere without
       needing to resolve the model first.
    2) Any async operations need to occur first before the
       model is attempted to be resolved.

    This hook is provided the current `transition` attempt
    as a parameter, which can be used to `.abort()` the transition,
    save it for a later `.retry()`, or retrieve values set
    on it from a previous hook. You can also just call
    `this.transitionTo` to another route to implicitly
    abort the `transition`.

    You can return a promise from this hook to pause the
    transition until the promise resolves (or rejects). This could
    be useful, for instance, for retrieving async code from
    the server that is required to enter a route.

    ```js
    App.PostRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      beforeModel: function(transition) {
        if (!App.Post) {
          return Ember.$.getScript('/models/post.js');
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    If `App.Post` doesn't exist in the above example,
    `beforeModel` will use jQuery's `getScript`, which
    returns a promise that resolves after the server has
    successfully retrieved and executed the code from the
    server. Note that if an error were to occur, it would
    be passed to the `error` hook on `Ember.Route`, but
    it's also possible to handle errors specific to
    `beforeModel` right from within the hook (to distinguish
    from the shared error handling behavior of the `error`
    hook):

    ```js
    App.PostRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      beforeModel: function(transition) {
        if (!App.Post) {
          var self = this;
          return Ember.$.getScript('post.js').then(null, function(e) {
            self.transitionTo('help');

            // Note that the above transitionTo will implicitly
            // halt the transition. If you were to return
            // nothing from this promise reject handler,
            // according to promise semantics, that would
            // convert the reject into a resolve and the
            // transition would continue. To propagate the
            // error so that it'd be handled by the `error`
            // hook, you would have to either
            return Ember.RSVP.reject(e);
            // or
            throw e;
          });

    A hook you can implement to convert the URL into the model for
    this route.

    ```js
    App.Router.map(function() {
      this.resource('post', {path: '/posts/:post_id'});
    });
    ```

    The model for the `post` route is `App.Post.find(params.post_id)`.

    By default, if your route has a dynamic segment ending in `_id`:

    * The model class is determined from the segment (`post_id`'s
      class is `App.Post`)
    * The find method is called on the model class with the value of
      the dynamic segment.

    Note that for routes with dynamic segments, this hook is only
    executed when entered via the URL. If the route is entered
    through a transition (e.g. when using the `linkTo` Handlebars
    helper), then a model context is already provided and this hook
    is not called. Routes without dynamic segments will always
    execute the model hook.

    This hook follows the asynchronous/promise semantics
    described in the documentation for `beforeModel`. In particular,
    if a promise returned from `model` fails, the error will be
    handled by the `error` hook on `Ember.Route`.

    By default, the `setupController` hook sets the `content` property of
    the controller to the `model`.

    This means that your template will get a proxy for the model as its
    context, and you can act as though the model itself was the context.

    The provided controller will be one resolved based on the name
    of this route.

    If no explicit controller is defined, Ember will automatically create
    an appropriate controller for the model.

    A hook you can use to render the template for the current route.

    This method is called with the controller for the current route and the
    model supplied by the `model` hook. By default, it renders the route's
    template, configured with the controller for the route.

    This method can be overridden to set up and render additional or
    alternative templates.

    ```js
    App.PostsRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      renderTemplate: function(controller, model) {

        // Render the `favoritePost` template into

          outlet: 'posts',
          controller: favController
        });
      }
    });
    ```

    @method renderTemplate
    @param {Object} controller the route's controller
    @param {Object} model the route's model
  */
  renderTemplate: function(controller, model) {
    this.render();
  },

  /**
    Renders a template into an outlet.

    This method has a number of defaults, based on the name of the
    route specified in the router.

    For example:

    ```js
    App.Router.map(function() {
      this.route('index');
      this.resource('post', {path: '/posts/:post_id'});
    });

    App.PostRoute = App.Route.extend({
      renderTemplate: function() {
        this.render();
      }
    });
    ```

    The name of the `PostRoute`, as defined by the router, is `post`.

    By default, render will:

    * render the `post` template
    * with the `post` view (`PostView`) for event handling, if one exists
    * and the `post` controller (`PostController`), if one exists
    * into the `main` outlet of the `application` template

    You can override this behavior:

    ```js
    App.PostRoute = App.Route.extend({
      renderTemplate: function() {
        this.render('myPost', {   // the template to render
          into: 'index',          // the template to render into
          outlet: 'detail',       // the name of the outlet in that template
          controller: 'blogPost'  // the controller to use for the template
        });
      }
    });
    ```

    Remember that the controller's `content` will be the route's model. In
    this case, the default model will be `App.Post.find(params.post_id)`.
