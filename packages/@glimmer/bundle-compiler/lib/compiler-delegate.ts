/**
 * A CompilerDelegate helps the BundleCompiler map external references it finds
 * in a template, such as other components and helpers, to their corresponding
 * implementation.
 *
 * For example, if the compiler comes across the string `<MyOtherComponent />`
 * in a template, it needs to know what template and component class on disk
 * `MyOtherComponent` refers to. By moving this decision-making to the delegate,
 * host environments can implement their own resolution semantics rather than
 * having resolution hardcoded into Glimmer.
 *
 * Because resolution often depends on where a component was invoked, many hooks
 * take a referrer, or the module locator for the template where the invocation
 * was found, as the second argument.
 *
 * For example, if the template with the locator `{ module:
 * 'src/ui/components/MyComponent.js', name: 'template' }` contains the string
 * `<MyOtherComponent />`, the compiler would invoke `hasComponentInScope` with
 * `'MyOtherComponent'` as the first argument and this locator as the second
 * argument.
 *
 * The CompilerDelegate is also responsible for describing the capabilities of a
 * particular component by returning a ComponentCapabilities descriptor. Glimmer
 * uses this information to perform additional optimizations during the
 * compilation phase.
