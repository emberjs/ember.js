AST v2 enhances the original AST with a number of clarifying features.

# Removals

`ASTv1` retains a node for Handlebars' "partial" syntax (`{{> ...}}`). ASTv2 does not include that node (just as neither version of the AST includes a node for Handlebars "decorator" syntax), as it is not supported by Glimmer.

# Naming Changes

There are a number of small naming changes that improve the clarity and precision of the AST:

1. `hash` -> `named`
2. `params` -> `positional`
3. `path` -> `callee`
4. `SubExpression` -> `CallExpression`
5. `BlockStatement` -> `InvokeBlock`
6. `MustacheStatement` -> `AppendContent`

# Literals

In `ASTv1`, there is a separate literal node for each kind of literal. In `ASTv2`, all literals are `ASTv2.Literal`.

# Args

In `ASTv1`, nodes have `params` and `hash` next to each other. In `ASTv2`, those nodes are grouped into an `Args` node that contains the `positional` and `named` arguments.

> Because `ASTv2` nodes are objects, this also allows these nodes to have an `isEmpty()` method, which makes it easy to check if a call node's arguments are totally empty.

# Blocks

All nodes that can have block parameters have a `table: BlockSymbolTable` property in `ASTv2`.

# Named Blocks

Elements that begin with a `:` are represented as `ASTv2.NamedBlock`.

# Components

Elements that satisfy the component heuristics are represented as `ASTv2.InvokeComponent`.

An element is a component if the part of its tag name before any `.`:

- begins with `@`
- is `this`
- is a reference to an in-scope binding
- begins with an uppercase letter

# Simple Elements

Elements that are not named blocks *and* do not satisfy the component heuristics are represented as `ASTv2.SimpleElement`.

# Strict vs. Loose Mode

The difference between strict and loose mode is entirely encapsulated in the `FreeVarReference`.

Consumers of `ASTv2` don't need to know whether they're looking at a "strict" or "loose" template. They just need to know how to handle the different contexts in `FreeVarReference`.

## Variable References

In `ASTv2`, every variable name is represented as a `VariableReference`.

> The first part of a `PathExpression` is a `VariableReference`.

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| `ThisReference` | the literal `this` |
| `ArgReference` | a variable reference that begins with with `@` |
| `LocalVarReference` | a reference to an in-scope variable binding |
| `FreeVarReference` | a reference to a variable binding that was not introduced by block params (`as |foo|`) |

**Important Note**: The remainder of this README is a description of the loose mode rules for free variable resolution. Strict mode free variable references always refer to an in-scope JavaScript binding, regardless of their syntactic position.

RFC [#496][#496] (Handlebars Strict Mode) rationalized the rules for loose mode. This README describes the semantics of [#496][#496] in terms of namespaced free variable references and fallback semantics.

### Free Variable References

There are two significant differences between strict and loose mode that affect the AST.

In loose mode:

1. Certain free variable references fall back to a property lookup on `this`.
2. Free variable references in "call" positions are resolved using a contextual namespace. For example, the free variable reference `h` in `(h 123)` is resolved as `helper:h`. The free variable reference `h` in `<p {{h 123}}>` is resolved as `modifier:h`.

In strict mode, all free variable references refer to bindings provided by a JavaScript scope that the template will be embedded within.

To represent this difference, all `FreeVarReference` nodes in ASTv2 are tagged with a `FreeVarResolution`.

### Strict Variable Resolution

The `Strict` resolution applies to all free variables encountered while parsing a template in strict mode.

#### Runtime Error Cases

None. Strict mode templates must be embedded in a JavaScript context where all free variable references are in scope. A compile-time error should be produced if free there are variable references that do not correspond to any in-scope variables.

### Fallback Semantics

When a free variable resolution is said to have "fallback semantics", it means the following algorithm:

1. Attempt to resolve the name in the namespaces for the resolution, if any.
2. If the name could not be resolved, resolve it as a property on `this`.

> Note: A free variable resolution has fallback semantics if it's an append or attribute curly without arguments, or if it's a path in argument position. See the summary table below for full details.

### Eval Mode Semantics

When a free variable resolution has fallback semantics, it is also said to have "eval mode semantics", which means:

1. If the template is evaluated in eval mode (i.e. as a partial), dynamically resolve the free variable in the context of the template that invoked the partial (the "invoker"):
  1. If the variable name is in the local scope of the invoker, resolve it as a *local* variable in the invoker's local scope
  2. Otherwise:
    1. if the invoker is also in eval mode, repeat the process with the invoker's invoker
    2. if the invoker is not in eval mode, resolve the free variable using fallback semantics in the invoker's scope
2. Otherwise, resolve the free variable using fallback semantics in the current scope

### Namespaced Variable Resolution

| | |
| - | - |
| Syntax Positions | `SubExpression`, `Block`, `Modifier`, `Component` |
| Path has dots? | ‚ùå |
| Arguments? | Any |
| | |
| Namespace | see table below |
| Fallback semantics? | ‚õî |

These resolutions occur in syntaxes that are definitely calls (e.g. subexpressions, blocks, modifiers, etc.).

#### Applicable Situation

| situation | variable | namespace |
| - | - | - |
| `(x y)` | `x` | `Helper` |
| `{{#x y}}` | `x` | `Block` |
| `<p {{x y}}>` | `x` | `Modifier` |
| `X` in `<X />` | `X` | `Component` |

#### Runtime Error Cases

If the variable reference cannot be resolved in its namespace.

### Namespaced Resolution: Ambiguous Component or Helper

| | |
| - | - |
| Syntax Positions | append |
| Path has dots? | ‚ùå |
| Arguments? | ‚ûï |
| | |
| Namespace | `helper` or `component` |
| Fallback semantics? | ‚õî |

This resolution occurs in append nodes with at least one argument, and when the path does not have dots (e.g. `{{hello world}}`).

#### Applicable Situation

| situation | variable | namespace |
| - | - | - |
| `{{x y}}` as append | `x` | `ComponentOrHelper` |

In this situation, the `x` may refer to:

- a helper `x`
- a component `x`

#### Runtime Error Cases

If the variable reference cannot be resolved in the `helper` or `component` namespaces.

### Ambiguous Resolution: Append Ambiguity

| | |
| - | - |
| Syntax Positions | append |
| Path has dots? | ‚ùå |
| Arguments? | ‚ùå |
| | |
| Namespace | `helper`, `component` |
| Fallback semantics? | ‚úÖ |

This resolution occurs in append nodes with zero arguments, and when the path does not have dots (e.g. `{{hello}}`).

#### Applicable Situations

| situation | variable | ambiguity |
| - | - | - |
| `{{x}}` as append | `x` | `Append` |

In this situation, the `x` may refer to:

- a helper `x`
- a component `x`
- a local variable in partial scope
- `this.x`.

#### Runtime Error Cases

None.

### Ambiguous Resolution: Attribute Ambiguity

This resolution context occurs in attribute nodes with zero arguments, and when the path does not have dots.

| | |
| - | - |
| Syntax Positions | attribute, interpolation |
| Path has dots? | ‚ùå |
| Arguments? | ‚ùå |
| | |
| Namespace | `helper` |
| Fallback semantics? | ‚úÖ |

#### Applicable Situations

| situation | variable | ambiguity |
| - | - | - |
| `<p attr={{x}}>` <br> `<a href="{{x}}.html">` | `x` | `Attr` |

In this situation, the `x` may refer to:

- a helper `x`
- a local variable in partial scope
- `this.x`.

#### Runtime Error Cases

None.

### Loose Free Variable Resolution

These resolution contexts occur in append or attribute nodes with zero positional or named arguments, and when the path has dots.

| | |
| - | - |
| Syntax Positions | append, attribute |
| Path has dots? | ‚ûï |
| Arguments? | ‚ùå |
| | |
| Namespace | None |
| Fallback semantics? | ‚úÖ |

#### Runtime Error Cases

None.

#### Applicable Situations

| situation | variable | resolution |
| - | - | - |
| `{{x.y}}` as append <br> `<p attr={{x.y}}>` <br> `<a href="{{x.y}}.html">` | `x` | `LooseFreeVariableResolution` |

In these situations, the `x` may refer to a local variable in partial scope, or it may refer to `this.x`.


### Summary

> These tables apply to situations where the head of the callee's path is a free variable. When the head is a local variable, it always uses strict resolution.

#### Syntax Errors üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Situations that meet all three of these criteria are syntax errors:

1. Unambiguous invocations
2. The callee contains a `.`
3. The head of the callee is a `FreeVarReference`

| Syntax Position | Example | Dots? | Arguments? |
| - | - | - | - |
| `Component` | `<X.y />` | ‚ûï | Any |
| `Modifier` | `<p {{x.y}} />` | ‚ûï | Any |
| `SubExpression` | `(x.y)` | ‚ûï | Any |
| `Block` | `{{#x.y}}` | ‚ûï | Any |
| `Append`, `Attribute` | `{{x.y z}}` | ‚ûï | ‚ûï |

#### Block, Component, Modifier, SubExpression

| | |
| - | - |
| Path has dots? | ‚ùå |
| Arguments? | Any |
| Fallback semantics? | ‚õî |

| Syntax Position | Example || Namespace  |
| - | - | - | - |
| `Block` | `{{#x}}` || `block` |
| `Component` | `<X />` || `component` |
| `Modifier` | `<p {{x}} />`  || `modifier` |
| `SubExpression` | `(x)` || `helper` |

#### Append

| `Append` | `{{x y}}`  | ‚ùå | ‚ûï|| `helper`, `component` | ‚õî |

#### Attributes

The `Attribute` syntax position includes:

- the value of an HTML attribute (`href={{...}}`)
- the value of an element argument (`@title={{...}}`)
- a part of an interpolation (`href="{{...}}.html"`)

| Syntax Position | Example  | Dots? | Arguments?| | Namespace | Fallback? |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| `Attribute` | `href={{x}}`  | ‚ùå | ‚ùå || `helper` | ‚úÖ |
