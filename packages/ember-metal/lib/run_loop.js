/**
  Allows you to specify which context to call the specified function in while
  adding the execution of that function to the Ember run loop. This ability
  makes this method a great way to asynchronously integrate third-party libraries
  into your Ember application.

  `run.bind` takes two main arguments, the desired context and the function to
  invoke in that context. Any additional arguments will be supplied as arguments
  to the function that is passed in.

  Let's use the creation of a TinyMCE component as an example. Currently,
  TinyMCE provides a setup configuration option we can use to do some processing
  after the TinyMCE instance is initialized but before it is actually rendered.
  We can use that setup option to do some additional setup for our component.
  The component itself could look something like the following:

  ```javascript
  App.RichTextEditorComponent = Ember.Component.extend({
    initializeTinyMCE: Ember.on('didInsertElement', function() {
      tinymce.init({
        selector: '#' + this.$().prop('id'),
        setup: Ember.run.bind(this, this.setupEditor)
      });
    }),

    setupEditor: function(editor) {
      this.set('editor', editor);

      editor.on('change', function() {
        console.log('content changed!');
      });
    }
  });
  ```

  In this example, we use Ember.run.bind to bind the setupEditor method to the
  context of the App.RichTextEditorComponent and to have the invocation of that
  method be safely handled and executed by the Ember run loop.

  @method bind
  @namespace Ember
  @param {Object} [target] target of method to call
  @param {Function|String} method Method to invoke.
    May be a function or a string. If you pass a string
    then it will be looked up on the passed target.
  @param {Object} [args*] Any additional arguments you wish to pass to the method.
  @return {Function} returns a new function that will always have a particular context

  });
  ```

  Also note that passing an anonymous function to `run.scheduleOnce` will
  not prevent additional calls with an identical anonymous function from
  scheduling the items multiple times, e.g.:

  ```javascript
  function scheduleIt() {
    run.scheduleOnce('actions', myContext, function() {
      console.log('Closure');
    });
  }

  scheduleIt();
  scheduleIt();

  // "Closure" will print twice, even though we're using `run.scheduleOnce`,
  // because the function we pass to it is anonymous and won't match the
  // previously scheduled operation.

/**
  Schedules an item to run from within a separate run loop, after
  control has been returned to the system. This is equivalent to calling
  `run.later` with a wait time of 1ms.

  ```javascript
  run.next(myContext, function() {
    // code to be executed in the next run loop,
    // which will be scheduled after the current one
  });
  ```

  Multiple operations scheduled with `run.next` will coalesce
  into the same later run loop, along with any other operations
  scheduled by `run.later` that expire right around the same
  time that `run.next` operations will fire.

  Note that there are often alternatives to using `run.next`.
  For instance, if you'd like to schedule an operation to happen
  after all DOM element operations have completed within the current
  run loop, you can make use of the `afterRender` run loop queue (added
  by the `ember-views` package, along with the preceding `render` queue
  where all the DOM element operations happen).

  Example:

  ```javascript
  export default Ember.Component.extend({
    didInsertElement() {
      this._super(...arguments);
      run.scheduleOnce('afterRender', this, 'processChildElements');
    },

    processChildElements() {
      // ... do something with component's child component
      // elements after they've finished rendering, which
      // can't be done within this component's
      // `didInsertElement` hook because that gets run
      // before the child elements have been added to the DOM.
    }
  });
  ```

  One benefit of the above approach compared to using `run.next` is
  that you will be able to perform DOM/CSS operations before unprocessed
  elements are rendered to the screen, which may prevent flickering or
  other artifacts caused by delaying processing until after rendering.

  The other major benefit to the above approach is that `run.next`
  introduces an element of non-determinism, which can make things much
  harder to test, due to its reliance on `setTimeout`; it's much harder
  to guarantee the order of scheduled operations when they are scheduled
  outside of the current run loop, i.e. with `run.next`.

  @param {Function|String} method The method to invoke.

  but the action should only be called once when the event is done firing.
  A common example is for scroll events where you only want updates to
  happen once scrolling has ceased.
