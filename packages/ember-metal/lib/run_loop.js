  Schedules a function to run one time in a given queue of the current RunLoop.
  Calling this method with the same queue/target/method combination will have
  no effect (past the initial call).

  Note that although you can pass optional arguments these will not be
  considered when looking for duplicates. New arguments will replace previous
  calls.

  ```javascript
  Ember.run(function() {
    var sayHi = function() { console.log('hi'); }
    Ember.run.scheduleOnce('afterRender', myContext, sayHi);
    Ember.run.scheduleOnce('afterRender', myContext, sayHi);
    // sayHi will only be executed once, in the afterRender queue of the RunLoop
  });
  ```

  Also note that passing an anonymous function to `Ember.run.scheduleOnce` will
  not prevent additional calls with an identical anonymous function from
  scheduling the items multiple times, e.g.:

  ```javascript
  function scheduleIt() {
    Ember.run.scheduleOnce('actions', myContext, function() { console.log("Closure"); });
  }
  scheduleIt();
  scheduleIt();
  // "Closure" will print twice, even though we're using `Ember.run.scheduleOnce`,
  // because the function we pass to it is anonymous and won't match the
  // previously scheduled operation.
  ```

  Available queues, and their order, can be found at `Ember.run.queues`

  @method scheduleOnce
  @param {String} [queue] The name of the queue to schedule against. Default queues are 'sync' and 'actions'.
  @param {Object} [target] The target of the method to invoke.
  @param {Function|String} method The method to invoke.
    If you pass a string it will be resolved on the
    target at the time the method is invoked.
  @param {Object} [args*] Optional arguments to pass to the timeout.

/**
  Schedules an item to run from within a separate run loop, after
  control has been returned to the system. This is equivalent to calling
  `Ember.run.later` with a wait time of 1ms.

  ```javascript
  Ember.run.next(myContext, function() {
    // code to be executed in the next run loop, which will be scheduled after the current one
  });
  ```

  Multiple operations scheduled with `Ember.run.next` will coalesce
  into the same later run loop, along with any other operations
  scheduled by `Ember.run.later` that expire right around the same
  time that `Ember.run.next` operations will fire.

  Note that there are often alternatives to using `Ember.run.next`.
  For instance, if you'd like to schedule an operation to happen
  after all DOM element operations have completed within the current
  run loop, you can make use of the `afterRender` run loop queue (added
  by the `ember-views` package, along with the preceding `render` queue
  where all the DOM element operations happen). Example:

  ```javascript
  App.MyCollectionView = Ember.CollectionView.extend({
    didInsertElement: function() {
      Ember.run.scheduleOnce('afterRender', this, 'processChildElements');
    },
    processChildElements: function() {
      // ... do something with collectionView's child view
      // elements after they've finished rendering, which
      // can't be done within the CollectionView's
      // `didInsertElement` hook because that gets run
      // before the child elements have been added to the DOM.
    }
  });
  ```

  One benefit of the above approach compared to using `Ember.run.next` is
  that you will be able to perform DOM/CSS operations before unprocessed
  elements are rendered to the screen, which may prevent flickering or
  other artifacts caused by delaying processing until after rendering.

  The other major benefit to the above approach is that `Ember.run.next`
  introduces an element of non-determinism, which can make things much
  harder to test, due to its reliance on `setTimeout`; it's much harder
  to guarantee the order of scheduled operations when they are scheduled
  outside of the current run loop, i.e. with `Ember.run.next`.

  @method next
  @param {Object} [target] target of method to invoke
  @param {Function|String} method The method to invoke.
    If you pass a string it will be resolved on the

  @param {Object} [args*] Optional arguments to pass to the timeout.
