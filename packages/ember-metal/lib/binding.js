// BINDING
//

/**
  @class

  A binding simply connects the properties of two objects so that whenever the
  value of one property changes, the other property will be changed also. You
  do not usually work with Binding objects directly but instead describe
  bindings in your class definition using something like:

        valueBinding: "MyApp.someController.title"

  This will create a binding from `MyApp.someController.title` to the `value`
  property of your object instance automatically. Now the two values will be
  kept in sync.

  ## Customizing Your Bindings

  In addition to synchronizing values, bindings can also perform some basic
  transforms on values. These transforms can help to make sure the data fed
  into one object always meets the expectations of that object regardless of
  what the other object outputs.

  To customize a binding, you can use one of the many helper methods defined
  on Ember.Binding like so:

        valueBinding: Ember.Binding.single("MyApp.someController.title")

  This will create a binding just like the example above, except that now the
  binding will convert the value of `MyApp.someController.title` to a single
  object (removing any arrays) before applying it to the `value` property of
  your object.

  You can also chain helper methods to build custom bindings like so:

        valueBinding: Ember.Binding.single("MyApp.someController.title").notEmpty("(EMPTY)")

  This will force the value of MyApp.someController.title to be a single value
  and then check to see if the value is "empty" (null, undefined, empty array,
  or an empty string). If it is empty, the value will be set to the string
  "(EMPTY)".

  ## One Way Bindings

  One especially useful binding customization you can use is the `oneWay()`
  helper. This helper tells Ember that you are only interested in
  receiving changes on the object you are binding from. For example, if you
  are binding to a preference and you want to be notified if the preference
  has changed, but your object will not be changing the preference itself, you
  could do:

        bigTitlesBinding: Ember.Binding.oneWay("MyApp.preferencesController.bigTitles")

  This way if the value of MyApp.preferencesController.bigTitles changes the
  "bigTitles" property of your object will change also. However, if you
  change the value of your "bigTitles" property, it will not update the
  preferencesController.

  One way bindings are almost twice as fast to setup and twice as fast to
  execute because the binding only has to worry about changes to one side.

  You should consider using one way bindings anytime you have an object that
  may be created frequently and you do not intend to change a property; only
  to monitor it for changes. (such as in the example above).

  ## Adding Custom Transforms

  In addition to using the standard helpers provided by Ember, you can
  also defined your own custom transform functions which will be used to
  convert the value. To do this, just define your transform function and add
  it to the binding with the transform() helper. The following example will
  not allow Integers less than ten. Note that it checks the value of the
  bindings and allows all other values to pass:

        valueBinding: Ember.Binding.transform(function(value, binding) {
          return ((Ember.typeOf(value) === 'number') && (value < 10)) ? 10 : value;
        }).from("MyApp.someController.value")

  If you would like to instead use this transform on a number of bindings,
  you can also optionally add your own helper method to Ember.Binding. This
  method should simply return the value of `this.transform()`. The example
  below adds a new helper called `notLessThan()` which will limit the value to
  be not less than the passed minimum:

      Ember.Binding.reopen({
        notLessThan: function(minValue) {
          return this.transform(function(value, binding) {
            return ((Ember.typeOf(value) === 'number') && (value < minValue)) ? minValue : value;
          });
        }
      });

  You could specify this in your core.js file, for example. Then anywhere in
  your application you can use it to define bindings like so:

        valueBinding: Ember.Binding.from("MyApp.someController.value").notLessThan(10)

  Also, remember that helpers are chained so you can use your helper along
  with any other helpers. The example below will create a one way binding that
  does not allow empty values or values less than 10:

        valueBinding: Ember.Binding.oneWay("MyApp.someController.value").notEmpty().notLessThan(10)

  ## How to Manually Adding Binding

  All of the examples above show you how to configure a custom binding, but
  the result of these customizations will be a binding template, not a fully
  active binding. The binding will actually become active only when you
  instantiate the object the binding belongs to. It is useful however, to
  understand what actually happens when the binding is activated.

  For a binding to function it must have at least a "from" property and a "to"
  property. The from property path points to the object/key that you want to
  bind from while the to path points to the object/key you want to bind to.

  When you define a custom binding, you are usually describing the property
  you want to bind from (such as "MyApp.someController.value" in the examples
  above). When your object is created, it will automatically assign the value
  you want to bind "to" based on the name of your binding key. In the
  examples above, during init, Ember objects will effectively call
  something like this on your binding:

        binding = Ember.Binding.from(this.valueBinding).to("value");

  This creates a new binding instance based on the template you provide, and
  sets the to path to the "value" property of the new object. Now that the
  binding is fully configured with a "from" and a "to", it simply needs to be
  connected to become active. This is done through the connect() method:

        binding.connect(this);

  Note that when you connect a binding you pass the object you want it to be
  connected to.  This object will be used as the root for both the from and
  to side of the binding when inspecting relative paths.  This allows the
  binding to be automatically inherited by subclassed objects as well.

  Now that the binding is connected, it will observe both the from and to side
  and relay changes.

  If you ever needed to do so (you almost never will, but it is useful to
  understand this anyway), you could manually create an active binding by
  using the Ember.bind() helper method. (This is the same method used by
  to setup your bindings on objects):

        Ember.bind(MyApp.anotherObject, "value", "MyApp.someController.value");

  Both of these code fragments have the same effect as doing the most friendly
  form of binding creation like so:

        MyApp.anotherObject = Ember.Object.create({
          valueBinding: "MyApp.someController.value",

          // OTHER CODE FOR THIS OBJECT...

        });

  Ember's built in binding creation method makes it easy to automatically
  create bindings for you. You should always use the highest-level APIs
  available, even if you understand how to it works underneath.
