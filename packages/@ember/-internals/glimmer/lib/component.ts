/**
  A component is a reusable UI element that consists of a `.hbs` template and an
  optional JavaScript class that defines its behavior. For example, someone
  might make a `button` in the template and handle the click behavior in the
  JavaScript file that shares the same name as the template.

  Components are broken down into two categories:

  - Components _without_ JavaScript, that are based only on a template. These
    are called Template-only or TO components.
  - Components _with_ JavaScript, which consist of a template and a backing
    class.

  Ember ships with two types of JavaScript classes for components:

  1. Glimmer components, imported from `@glimmer/component`, which are the
     default component's for Ember Octane (3.15) and more recent editions.
  2. Classic components, imported from `@ember/component`, which were the
     default for older editions of Ember (pre 3.15).

  Below is the documentation for Classic components. If you are looking for the
  API documentation for Template-only or Glimmer components, it is [available
  here](/ember/release/modules/@glimmer%2Fcomponent).

  ## Defining a Classic Component

  If you want to customize the component in order to handle events, transform
  arguments or maintain internal state, you implement a subclass of `Component`.

  One example is to add computed properties to your component:

  ```app/components/person-profile.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    @computed('person.title', 'person.firstName', 'person.lastName')
    get displayName() {
      let { title, firstName, lastName } = this.person;

      if (title) {
        return `${title} ${lastName}`;
      } else {
        return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  And then use it in the component's template:

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>{{this.displayName}}</h1>
  {{yield}}
  ```

  ## Customizing a Classic Component's HTML Element in JavaScript

  ### HTML Tag

  The default HTML tag name used for a component's HTML representation is `div`.
  This can be customized by setting the `tagName` property.

  Consider the following component class:

  ```app/components/emphasized-paragraph.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'em';
  }
  ```

  When invoked, this component would produce output that looks something like
  this:

  ```html
  <em id="ember1" class="ember-view"></em>
  ```

  ### HTML `class` Attribute

  The HTML `class` attribute of a component's tag can be set by providing a
  `classNames` property that is set to an array of strings:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNames = ['my-class', 'my-other-class'];
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce output that looks like this:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view my-class my-other-class"></div>
  ```

  `class` attribute values can also be set by providing a `classNameBindings`
  property set to an array of properties names for the component. The return
  value of these properties will be added as part of the value for the
  components's `class` attribute. These properties can be computed properties:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';
  import { computed } from '@ember/object';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNames = ['my-class', 'my-other-class'];
    classNameBindings = ['propertyA', 'propertyB'];

    propertyA = 'from-a';

    get propertyB {
      if (someLogic) { return 'from-b'; }
    }
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view my-class my-other-class from-a from-b"></div>
  ```

  Note that `classNames` and `classNameBindings` is in addition to the `class`
  attribute passed with the angle bracket invocation syntax. Therefore, if this
  component was invoked like so:

  ```handlebars
  <MyWidget class="from-invocation" />
  ```

  The resulting HTML will look similar to this:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="from-invocation ember-view my-class my-other-class from-a from-b"></div>
  ```

  If the value of a class name binding returns a boolean the property name
  itself will be used as the class name if the property is true. The class name
  will not be added if the value is `false` or `undefined`.

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['hovered'];

    hovered = true;
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view hovered"></div>
  ```

  ### Custom Class Names for Boolean Values

  When using boolean class name bindings you can supply a string value other
  than the property name for use as the `class` HTML attribute by appending the
  preferred value after a ":" character when defining the binding:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['awesome:so-very-cool'];

    awesome = true;
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view so-very-cool"></div>
  ```

  Boolean value class name bindings whose property names are in a
  camelCase-style format will be converted to a dasherized format:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['isUrgent'];

    isUrgent = true;
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view is-urgent"></div>
  ```

  Class name bindings can also refer to object values that are found by
  traversing a path relative to the component itself:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';
  import EmberObject from '@ember/object';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['messages.empty'];

    messages = EmberObject.create({
      empty: true
    });
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view empty"></div>
  ```

  If you want to add a class name for a property which evaluates to true and and
  a different class name if it evaluates to false, you can pass a binding like
  this:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['isEnabled:enabled:disabled'];

    isEnabled = true;
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view enabled"></div>
  ```

  When isEnabled is `false`, the resulting HTML representation looks like this:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view disabled"></div>
  ```

  This syntax offers the convenience to add a class if a property is `false`:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  // Applies no class when isEnabled is true and class 'disabled' when isEnabled is false
  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['isEnabled::disabled'];

    isEnabled = true;
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component when the `isEnabled` property is true will produce
  HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view"></div>
  ```

  Invoking it when the `isEnabled` property on the component is `false` will
  produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view disabled"></div>
  ```

  Updates to the value of a class name binding will result in automatic update
  of the  HTML `class` attribute in the component's rendered HTML
  representation. If the value becomes `false` or `undefined` the class name
  will be removed.

  Both `classNames` and `classNameBindings` are concatenated properties. See
  [EmberObject](/ember/release/classes/EmberObject) documentation for more
  information about concatenated properties.

  ### Other HTML Attributes

  The HTML attribute section of a component's tag can be set by providing an
  `attributeBindings` property set to an array of property names on the
  component. The return value of these properties will be used as the value of
  the component's HTML associated attribute:

  ```app/components/my-anchor.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'a';
    attributeBindings = ['href'];

    href = 'http://google.com';
  };
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <a id="ember1" class="ember-view" href="http://google.com"></a>
  ```

  One property can be mapped on to another by placing a ":" between the source
  property and the destination property:

  ```app/components/my-anchor.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'a';
    attributeBindings = ['url:href'];

    url = 'http://google.com';
  };
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <a id="ember1" class="ember-view" href="http://google.com"></a>
  ```

  HTML attributes passed with angle bracket invocations will take precedence
  over those specified in `attributeBindings`. Therefore, if this component was
  invoked like so:

  ```handlebars
  <MyAnchor href="http://bing.com" @url="http://google.com" />
  ```

  The resulting HTML will looks like this:

  ```html
  <a id="ember1" class="ember-view" href="http://bing.com"></a>
  ```

  Note that the `href` attribute is ultimately set to `http://bing.com`, despite
  it having attribute binidng to the `url` property, which was set to
  `http://google.com`.

  Namespaced attributes (e.g. `xlink:href`) are supported, but have to be
  mapped, since `:` is not a valid character for properties in Javascript:

  ```app/components/my-use.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'use';
    attributeBindings = ['xlinkHref:xlink:href'];

    xlinkHref = '#triangle';
  };
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <use xlink:href="#triangle"></use>
  ```

  If the value of a property monitored by `attributeBindings` is a boolean, the
  attribute will be present or absent depending on the value:

  ```app/components/my-text-input.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'input';
    attributeBindings = ['disabled'];

    disabled = false;
  };
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <input id="ember1" class="ember-view" />
  ```

  `attributeBindings` can refer to computed properties:

  ```app/components/my-text-input.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';
  import { computed } from '@ember/object';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'input';
    attributeBindings = ['disabled'];

    get disabled() {
      if (someLogic) {
        return true;
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    }
  };
  ```

  To prevent setting an attribute altogether, use `null` or `undefined` as the
  value of the property used in `attributeBindings`:

  ```app/components/my-text-input.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'form';
    attributeBindings = ['novalidate'];
    novalidate = null;
  };
  ```

  Updates to the property of an attribute binding will result in automatic
  update of the  HTML attribute in the component's HTML output.

  `attributeBindings` is a concatenated property. See
  [EmberObject](/ember/release/classes/EmberObject) documentation for more
  information about concatenated properties.

  ## Layouts

  The `layout` property can be used to dynamically specify a template associated
  with a component class, instead of relying on Ember to link together a
  component class and a template based on file names.

  In general, applications should not use this feature, but it's commonly used
  in addons for historical reasons.

  The `layout` property should be set to the default export of a template
  module, which is the name of a template file without the `.hbs` extension.

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>Person's Title</h1>
  <div class='details'>{{yield}}</div>
  ```

  ```app/components/person-profile.js
    import Component from '@ember/component';
    import layout from '../templates/components/person-profile';

    export default class extends Component {
      layout = layout;
    }
  ```

  If you invoke the component:

  ```handlebars
  <PersonProfile>
    <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>
    <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>
  </PersonProfile>
  ```

  or

  ```handlebars
  {{#person-profile}}
    <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>
    <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>
  {{/person-profile}}
  ```

  It will result in the following HTML output:

  ```html
  <h1>Person's Title</h1>
    <div class="details">
    <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>
    <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>
  </div>
  ```

  ## Handling Browser Events

  There are two ways to handle user-initiated events:

  ### Using the `on` modifier to capture browser events

  In a component's template, you can attach an event handler to any element with the `on` modifier:

  ```handlebars
  <button {{on 'click' this.doSomething}} />
  ```

  This will call the function on your component:

  ```js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class ExampleComponent extends Component {
    doSomething = (event) => {
      // `event` is the native click Event
      console.log('clicked on the button');
    };
  }
  ```

  See the [Guide on Component event
  handlers](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/component-state-and-actions/#toc_html-modifiers-and-actions)
  and the [API docs for `on`](../Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/on?anchor=on)
  for more details.

  ### Event Handler Methods

  Components can also respond to user-initiated events by implementing a method
  that matches the event name. This approach is appropriate when the same event
  should be handled by all instances of the same component.

  An event object will be passed as the argument to the event handler method.

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    click(event) {
      // `event.target` is either the component's element or one of its children
      let tag = event.target.tagName.toLowerCase();
      console.log('clicked on a `<${tag}>` HTML element!');
    }
  }
  ```

  In this example, whenever the user clicked anywhere inside the component, it
  will log a message to the console.

  It is possible to handle event types other than `click` by implementing the
  following event handler methods. In addition, custom events can be registered
  by using `Application.customEvents`.

  Touch events:

  * `touchStart`
  * `touchMove`
  * `touchEnd`
  * `touchCancel`

  Keyboard events:

  * `keyDown`
  * `keyUp`
  * `keyPress`

  Mouse events:

  * `mouseDown`
  * `mouseUp`
  * `contextMenu`
  * `click`
  * `doubleClick`
  * `focusIn`
  * `focusOut`

  Form events:

  * `submit`
  * `change`
  * `focusIn`
  * `focusOut`
  * `input`

  Drag and drop events:

  * `dragStart`
  * `drag`
  * `dragEnter`
  * `dragLeave`
  * `dragOver`
  * `dragEnd`
  * `drop`

    import Component from '@ember/component';
    Component.extend({
      classNameBindings: ['priority'],
      priority: 'high'
    });
    ```

    If the value of the property is a Boolean, the name of that property is
    added as a dasherized class name.

    ```javascript
    // Applies the 'is-urgent' class to the view element
    import Component from '@ember/component';
    Component.extend({
      classNameBindings: ['isUrgent'],
      isUrgent: true
    });
    ```

    If you would prefer to use a custom value instead of the dasherized
    property name, you can pass a binding like this:

    ```javascript
    // Applies the 'urgent' class to the view element
    import Component from '@ember/component';
    Component.extend({
      classNameBindings: ['isUrgent:urgent'],
      isUrgent: true
    });
    ```

    If you would like to specify a class that should only be added when the
    property is false, you can declare a binding like this:

    ```javascript
    // Applies the 'disabled' class to the view element
    import Component from '@ember/component';
    Component.extend({
      classNameBindings: ['isEnabled::disabled'],
      isEnabled: false
    });
    ```

    This list of properties is inherited from the component's superclasses as well.

  declare classNameBindings: string[];

    this._superRerender = this.rerender;
    this.rerender = this._rerender;

  /**
    Normally, Ember's component model is "write-only". The component takes a
    bunch of attributes that it got passed in, and uses them to render its
    template.

    One nice thing about this model is that if you try to set a value to the
    same thing as last time, Ember (through HTMLBars) will avoid doing any
    work on the DOM.

    This is not just a performance optimization. If an attribute has not
    changed, it is important not to clobber the element's "hidden state".
    For example, if you set an input's `value` to the same value as before,
    it will clobber selection state and cursor position. In other words,
    setting an attribute is not **always** idempotent.

    This method provides a way to read an element's attribute and also
    update the last value Ember knows about at the same time. This makes
    setting an attribute idempotent.

    In particular, what this means is that if you get an `<input>` element's
    `value` attribute and then re-render the template with the same value,
    it will avoid clobbering the cursor and selection position.
    Since most attribute sets are idempotent in the browser, you typically
    can get away with reading attributes using jQuery, but the most reliable
    way to do so is through this method.

  // --- Declarations which support mixins ---
  // We use `declare` on these properties, even though they are optional, so
  // that they do not get created on the class *at all* when emitting the
  // transpiled code. Otherwise, since declared class properties are equivalent
  // to calling `defineProperty` in the class constructor, they would "stomp"
  // the properties supplied by mixins.

  /**
   A list of properties of the view to apply as attributes. If the property
   is a string value, the value of that string will be applied as the value
   for an attribute of the property's name.

   The following example creates a tag like `<div priority="high" />`.

   ```app/components/my-component.js
   import Component from '@ember/component';

   export default Component.extend({
      attributeBindings: ['priority'],
      priority: 'high'
    });
   ```

   If the value of the property is a Boolean, the attribute is treated as
   an HTML Boolean attribute. It will be present if the property is `true`
   and omitted if the property is `false`.

   The following example creates markup like `<div visible />`.

   ```app/components/my-component.js
   import Component from '@ember/component';

   export default Component.extend({
      attributeBindings: ['visible'],
      visible: true
    });
   ```

   If you would prefer to use a custom value instead of the property name,
   you can create the same markup as the last example with a binding like
   this:

   ```app/components/my-component.js
   import Component from '@ember/component';

   export default Component.extend({
      attributeBindings: ['isVisible:visible'],
      isVisible: true
    });
   ```

   This list of attributes is inherited from the component's superclasses,
   as well.
