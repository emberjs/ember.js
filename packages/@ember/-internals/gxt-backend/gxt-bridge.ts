/**
 * gxt-bridge — Cluster B pilot
 *
 * Typed capabilities bridge between sibling modules in `@ember/-internals/gxt-backend`
 * (and a small number of cross-package consumers). Replaces ad-hoc
 * `(globalThis as any).__gxt*` 1-writer/1-reader pairs.
 *
 * Why a separate module (rather than direct imports between sibling files)?
 * `manager.ts` and `compile.ts` historically don't import each other — adding a
 * direct import edge would create circular-load hazards during gxt-backend's
 * module init (both are very large files with eagerly-evaluated top-level
 * `(globalThis as any).__gxtFoo = ...` statements that the other side then reads
 * at top-level too).
 *
 * Instead this module is a LEAF: it imports nothing from gxt-backend internals
 * and only exposes a tiny mutable registry. The writer (manager.ts) calls
 * `setGxtRenderer({ ... })` exactly once at module init; readers
 * (compile.ts, ember-gxt-wrappers.ts) read through `getGxtRenderer()`.
 *
 * Contract:
 *  - `setGxtRenderer` is called exactly once, at gxt-backend module init
 *    (manager.ts top-level). Classic-Ember builds NEVER import gxt-backend, so
 *    the registry stays `null` and every reader's `if (renderer)` guard turns
 *    into a dead-code branch that `__GXT_MODE__` strips at bundle time.
 *  - Capabilities are added to the interface incrementally as more globalThis
 *    bridges are migrated. This pilot covers the "destruction" capability
 *    cluster only (6 hooks). Future iterations will add scheduling, lifecycle,
 *    cell-mirror, etc.
 *  - All methods are best-effort (callers must remain defensive). The bridge
 *    does NOT add behavior on top of the underlying call; it's a typed
 *    indirection only.
 *
 * Anti-patterns this bridge AVOIDS:
 *  - No `globalThis` writes (the whole point).
 *  - No imports back into manager.ts / compile.ts (would re-introduce the
 *    cycles the globalThis pattern existed to avoid).
 *  - No `__GXT_MODE__` gating inside the bridge itself — classic builds drop
 *    the entire import edge to gxt-backend via build-time dead-code elimination.
