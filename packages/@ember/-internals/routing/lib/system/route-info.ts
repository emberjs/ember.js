/**
  A `RouteInfoWithAttributes` is an object that contains
  metadata, including the resolved value from the routes
  `model` hook. Like `RouteInfo`, a `RouteInfoWithAttributes`
  represents a specific route with in a Transition.
  It is read-only and internally immutable. It is also not
  observable, because a Transition instance is never
  changed after creation.

  Allows you to traverse through the linked list
  of `RouteInfo`s from the topmost to leafmost.
  Returns the first `RouteInfo` in the linked list
  for which the callback returns true.

    This method is similar to the `find()` method
    defined in ECMAScript 2015.

    The callback method you provide should have the
    following signature (all parameters are optional):

    ```javascript
    function(item, index, array);
    ```

    - `item` is the current item in the iteration.
    - `index` is the current index in the iteration.
    - `array` is the array itself.

    It should return the `true` to include the item in
    the results, `false` otherwise.

    Note that in addition to a callback, you can also
    pass an optional target object that will be set as
    `this` on the context.

  @param {Function} callback the callback to execute
  @param {Object} [target*] optional target to use
