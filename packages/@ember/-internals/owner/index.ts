 * // For concrete singleton classes to be merged into.
 * interface Registry extends Record<string, Singleton> {}

 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Then users of the `Owner` API will be able to reliably do things like this,
 * assuming a `some-class` registration exists:
 *
 * ```ts
 * getOwner(this)?.lookup('singleton:some-class').requiredHook();
 * ```

    Registers a factory that can be used for dependency injection (with
    `inject`) or for service lookup. Each factory is registered with
    a full name including two parts: `type:name`.

    A simple example:

    ```javascript
    import Application from '@ember/application';
    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';

    let App = Application.create();

    App.Orange = EmberObject.extend();
    App.register('fruit:favorite', App.Orange);
    ```

    Ember will resolve factories from the `App` namespace automatically.
    For example `App.CarsController` will be discovered and returned if
    an application requests `controller:cars`.

    An example of registering a controller with a non-standard name:

    ```javascript
    import Application from '@ember/application';
    import Controller from '@ember/controller';

    let App = Application.create();
    let Session = Controller.extend();

    App.register('controller:session', Session);

    // The Session controller can now be treated like a normal controller,
    // despite its non-standard name.
    App.ApplicationController = Controller.extend({
      needs: ['session']
    });
    ```

    Registered factories are **instantiated** by having `create`
    called on them. Additionally they are **singletons**, each time
    they are looked up they return the same instance.

    Some examples modifying that default behavior:

    ```javascript
    import Application from '@ember/application';
    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';

    let App = Application.create();

    App.Person = EmberObject.extend();
    App.Orange = EmberObject.extend();
    App.Email = EmberObject.extend();
    App.session = EmberObject.create();

    App.register('model:user', App.Person, { singleton: false });
    App.register('fruit:favorite', App.Orange);
    App.register('communication:main', App.Email, { singleton: false });
    App.register('session', App.session, { instantiate: false });
    ```

    @method register
    @param  fullName {String} type:name (e.g., 'model:user')
    @param  factory {any} (e.g., App.Person)
    @param  options {Object} (optional) disable instantiation or singleton usage
    @public
   */

  // weird type here. We actually allow more or less *anything* to be passed
  // here. In the future, we may possibly be able to update this to actually
