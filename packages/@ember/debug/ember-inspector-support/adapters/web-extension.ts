    // not work. This sometimes causes problems, because, e.g. if the

    // to that div and shadow the "global" inspect function with no way
    // to get it back. That causes "`inspect` is not a function" errors.

    // As it turns out, however, when the extension page evals, the
    // `inspect` function does not get shadowed. So, we can ask the
    // inspector extension page to call that function for us, using
    // `inspected.Window.eval('inspect(node)')`.
