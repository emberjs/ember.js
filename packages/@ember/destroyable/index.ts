/**
  Ember manages the lifecycles and lifetimes of many built in constructs, such
  as components, and does so in a hierarchical way - when a parent component is
  destroyed, all of its children are destroyed as well.

  This destroyables API exposes the basic building blocks for destruction:

  * registering a function to be ran when an object is destroyyed
  * checking if an object is in a destroying state
  * associate an object as a child of another so that the child object will be destroyed
    when the associated parent object is destroyed.

  @module @ember/destroyable
  @public

/**
  This function is used to associate a destroyable object with a parent. When the parent
  is destroyed, all registered children will also be destroyed.

  ```js
  class CustomSelect extends Component {
    constructor() {
      // obj is now a child of the component. When the component is destroyed,
      // obj will also be destroyed, and have all of its destructors triggered.
      this.obj = associateDestroyableChild(this, {});
    }
  }
  ```

  Returns the associated child for convenience.

  @method associateDestroyableChild
  @for @ember/destroyable
  @param {Object|Function} parent the destroyable to entangle the child destroyables lifetime with
  @param {Object|Function} child the destroyable to be entangled with the parents lifetime

  @returns {Object|Function} the child argument

/**
  Initiates the destruction of a destroyable object. It runs all associated destructors, and then
  destroys all children recursively.

  ```js
  let obj = {};

  registerDestructor(obj, () => console.log('destroyed!'));

  destroy(obj); // this will schedule the destructor to be called

  // ...some time later, during scheduled destruction

  // destroyed!
  ```

  Destruction via `destroy()` follows these steps:

  1, Mark the destroyable such that `isDestroying(destroyable)` returns `true`
  2, Call `destroy()` on each of the destroyable's associated children
  3, Schedule calling the destroyable's destructors
  4, Schedule setting destroyable such that `isDestroyed(destroyable)` returns `true`

  This results in the entire tree of destroyables being first marked as destroying,
  then having all of their destructors called, and finally all being marked as isDestroyed.
  There won't be any in between states where some items are marked as `isDestroying` while
  destroying, while others are not.

/**
  This function asserts that all objects which have associated destructors or associated children

  available in non-production builds.

/**
  This function instructs the destroyable system to keep track of all destroyables (their
  children, destructors, etc). This enables a future usage of `assertDestroyablesDestroyed`
  to be used to ensure that all destroyable tasks (registered destructors and associated children)
  have completed when `assertDestroyablesDestroyed` is called.

/**
  Receives a destroyable object and a destructor function, and associates the
  function with it. When the destroyable is destroyed with destroy, or when its
  parent is destroyed, the destructor function will be called.

  ```js
  import { registerDestructor } from '@ember/destroyable';

  class Modal extends Component {
    @service resize;

    constructor() {
      this.resize.register(this, this.layout);

      registerDestructor(this, () => this.resize.unregister(this));
    }
  }
  ```

  Multiple destructors can be associated with a given destroyable, and they can be
  associated over time, allowing libraries to dynamically add destructors as needed.
  `registerDestructor` also returns the associated destructor function, for convenience.

  The destructor function is passed a single argument, which is the destroyable itself.
  This allows the function to be reused multiple times for many destroyables, rather
  than creating a closure function per destroyable.

  ```js
  import { registerDestructor } from '@ember/destroyable';

  function unregisterResize(instance) {
    instance.resize.unregister(instance);
  }

  class Modal extends Component {
    @service resize;

    constructor() {
      this.resize.register(this, this.layout);

      registerDestructor(this, unregisterResize);
