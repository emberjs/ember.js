  @class

  Restores some of the Ember 1.x Ember.Observable mixin API.  The new property 
  observing system does not require Ember.Observable to be applied anymore.
  Instead, on most browsers you can just access properties directly.  For
  code that needs to run on IE7 or IE8 you should use Ember.get() and Ember.set()
  instead.
  
  If you have older code and you want to bring back the older Ember 1.x observable
  API, you can do so by readding Ember.Observable to Ember.Object like so:
  
      Ember.Object.reopen(Ember.Observable);
    
  You will then be able to use the traditional get(), set() and other 
  observable methods on your objects.

  /**
    Retrieves the value of key from the object.

    This method is generally very similar to using object[key] or object.key,
    however it supports both computed properties and the unknownProperty
    handler.

    ## Computed Properties

    Computed properties are methods defined with the property() modifier
    declared at the end, such as:

          fullName: function() {
            return this.getEach('firstName', 'lastName').compact().join(' ');
          }.property('firstName', 'lastName')

    When you call get() on a computed property, the property function will be
    called and the return value will be returned instead of the function
    itself.

    ## Unknown Properties

    Likewise, if you try to call get() on a property whose values is
    undefined, the unknownProperty() method will be called on the object.
    If this method reutrns any value other than undefined, it will be returned
    instead. This allows you to implement "virtual" properties that are
    not defined upfront.

    @param {String} key The property to retrieve
    @returns {Object} The property value or undefined.
  */
  get: function(keyName) {
    return get(this, keyName);
  },

  /**
    To get multiple properties at once, call getProperties
    with a list of strings:

          record.getProperties('firstName', 'lastName', 'zipCode');

    @param {String...} list of keys to get
    @returns {Hash}
  */
  getProperties: function() {
    var ret = {};
    for(var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
      ret[arguments[i]] = get(this, arguments[i]);
    }
    return ret;
  },
  
  /**
    Sets the key equal to value.

    This method is generally very similar to calling object[key] = value or
    object.key = value, except that it provides support for computed
    properties, the unknownProperty() method and property observers.

    ## Computed Properties

    If you try to set a value on a key that has a computed property handler
    defined (see the get() method for an example), then set() will call
    that method, passing both the value and key instead of simply changing
    the value itself. This is useful for those times when you need to
    implement a property that is composed of one or more member
    properties.

    ## Unknown Properties

    If you try to set a value on a key that is undefined in the target
    object, then the unknownProperty() handler will be called instead. This
    gives you an opportunity to implement complex "virtual" properties that
    are not predefined on the obejct. If unknownProperty() returns
    undefined, then set() will simply set the value on the object.

    ## Property Observers

    In addition to changing the property, set() will also register a
    property change with the object. Unless you have placed this call
    inside of a beginPropertyChanges() and endPropertyChanges(), any "local"
    observers (i.e. observer methods declared on the same object), will be
    called immediately. Any "remote" observers (i.e. observer methods
    declared on another object) will be placed in a queue and called at a
    later time in a coelesced manner.

    ## Chaining

    In addition to property changes, set() returns the value of the object
    itself so you can do chaining like this:

          record.set('firstName', 'Charles').set('lastName', 'Jolley');

    @param {String} key The property to set
    @param {Object} value The value to set or null.
    @returns {Ember.Observable}
  */
  set: function(keyName, value) {
    set(this, keyName, value);
    return this;
  },
  
  /**
    To set multiple properties at once, call setProperties
    with a Hash:

          record.setProperties({ firstName: 'Charles', lastName: 'Jolley' });

    @param {Hash} hash the hash of keys and values to set
    @returns {Ember.Observable}
  */
  setProperties: function(hash) {
    Ember.beginPropertyChanges(this);
    for(var prop in hash) {
      if (hash.hasOwnProperty(prop)) set(this, prop, hash[prop]);
    }
    Ember.endPropertyChanges(this);
    return this;
  },

  /**
    Adds an observer on a property.

    This is the core method used to register an observer for a property.

    Once you call this method, anytime the key's value is set, your observer
    will be notified. Note that the observers are triggered anytime the
    value is set, regardless of whether it has actually changed. Your
    observer should be prepared to handle that.

    You can also pass an optional context parameter to this method. The
    context will be passed to your observer method whenever it is triggered.
    Note that if you add the same target/method pair on a key multiple times
    with different context parameters, your observer will only be called once
    with the last context you passed.

    ## Observer Methods

    Observer methods you pass should generally have the following signature if
    you do not pass a "context" parameter:

          fooDidChange: function(sender, key, value, rev);

    The sender is the object that changed. The key is the property that
    changes. The value property is currently reserved and unused. The rev
    is the last property revision of the object when it changed, which you can
    use to detect if the key value has really changed or not.

    If you pass a "context" parameter, the context will be passed before the
    revision like so:

          fooDidChange: function(sender, key, value, context, rev);

    Usually you will not need the value, context or revision parameters at
    the end. In this case, it is common to write observer methods that take
    only a sender and key value as parameters or, if you aren't interested in
    any of these values, to write an observer that has no parameters at all.

    @param {String} key The key to observer
    @param {Object} target The target object to invoke
    @param {String|Function} method The method to invoke.
    @returns {Ember.Object} self
  */
  addObserver: function(key, target, method) {

    the same key, target, and method you passed to addObserver() and your
    target will no longer receive notifications.

    @param {String} key The key to observer
    @param {Object} target The target object to invoke
