/**
  An `Ember.Component` is a view that is completely
  isolated. Properties accessed in its templates go
  to the view object and actions are targeted at
  the view object. There is no access to the
  surrounding context or outer controller; all
  contextual information must be passed in.

  The easiest way to create an `Ember.Component` is via
  a template. If you name a template
  `components/my-foo`, you will be able to use
  `{{my-foo}}` in other templates, which will make
  an instance of the isolated component.

  ```handlebars
  {{app-profile person=currentUser}}
  ```

  ```handlebars
  <!-- app-profile template -->
  <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>
  <img src={{person.avatar}}>
  <p class='signature'>{{person.signature}}</p>
  ```

  You can use `yield` inside a template to
  include the **contents** of any block attached to
  the component. The block will be executed in the
  context of the surrounding context or outer controller:

  ```handlebars
  {{#app-profile person=currentUser}}
    <p>Admin mode</p>
    {{! Executed in the controller's context. }}
  {{/app-profile}}
  ```

  ```handlebars
  <!-- app-profile template -->
  <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>
  {{! Executed in the component's context. }}
  {{yield}} {{! block contents }}
  ```

  If you want to customize the component, in order to
  handle events or actions, you implement a subclass
  of `Ember.Component` named after the name of the
  component. Note that `Component` needs to be appended to the name of
  your subclass like `AppProfileComponent`.

  For example, you could implement the action
  `hello` for the `app-profile` component:

  ```javascript
  App.AppProfileComponent = Ember.Component.extend({
    actions: {
      hello: function(name) {
        console.log("Hello", name);
      }
    }
  });
  ```

  And then use it in the component's template:

  ```handlebars
  <!-- app-profile template -->

  <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>
  {{yield}} <!-- block contents -->

  <button {{action 'hello' person.name}}>
    Say Hello to {{person.name}}
  </button>
  ```

  Components must have a `-` in their name to avoid
  conflicts with built-in controls that wrap HTML
  elements. This is consistent with the same
  requirement in web components.

    Calls a action passed to a component.

    For example a component for playing or pausing music may translate click events
    into action notifications of "play" or "stop" depending on some internal state
    of the component:

    ```javascript
    // app/components/play-button.js
    export default Ember.Component.extend({
      click() {
        if (this.get('isPlaying')) {
          this.sendAction('play');
        } else {
          this.sendAction('stop');
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    The actions "play" and "stop" must be passed to this `play-button` component:

    ```handlebars
    {{! app/templates/application.hbs }}
    {{play-button play=(action "musicStarted") stop=(action "musicStopped")}}
    ```

    When the component receives a browser `click` event it translate this
    interaction into application-specific semantics ("play" or "stop") and
    calls the specified action.

    ```javascript
    // app/controller/application.js
    export default Ember.Controller.extend({
      actions: {
        musicStarted() {
          // called when the play button is clicked
          // and the music started playing
        },
        musicStopped() {
          // called when the play button is clicked
          // and the music stopped playing
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    If no action is passed to `sendAction` a default name of "action"
    is assumed.

    ```javascript
    // app/components/next-button.js
    export default Ember.Component.extend({
      click() {
        this.sendAction();
      }
    });
    ```

    ```handlebars
    {{! app/templates/application.hbs }}
    {{next-button action=(action "playNextSongInAlbum")}}
    ```

    ```javascript
    // app/controllers/application.js
    App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({
      actions: {
        playNextSongInAlbum() {
          ...
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    }
