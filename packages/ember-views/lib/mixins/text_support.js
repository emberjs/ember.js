/**
  `TextSupport` is a shared mixin used by both `Ember.TextField` and
  `Ember.TextArea`. `TextSupport` adds a number of methods that allow you to
  specify a controller action to invoke when a certain event is fired on your
  text field or textarea. The specifed controller action would get the current
  value of the field passed in as the only argument unless the value of
  the field is empty. In that case, the instance of the field itself is passed
  in as the only argument.

  Let's use the pressing of the escape key as an example. If you wanted to
  invoke a controller action when a user presses the escape key while on your
  field, you would use the `escape-press` attribute on your field like so:

  ```handlebars
    {{! application.hbs}}

    {{input escape-press='alertUser'}}
  ```

  ```javascript
      App = Ember.Application.create();

      App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({
        actions: {
          alertUser: function ( currentValue ) {
            alert( 'escape pressed, current value: ' + currentValue );
          }
        }
      });
  ```

  The following chart is a visual representation of what takes place when the
  escape key is pressed in this scenario:

  ```

  | escape-press='alertUser'  |

       +-------------------------------> | checks for the `escape-press` |
                                         | attribute and pulls out the   |
       +-------------------------------+ | `alertUser` value             |
       |     action name 'alertUser'     +-------------------------------+
       |     sent to controller
       v
  Controller
  +------------------------------------------ +
  |                                           |
  |  actions: {                               |
  |     alertUser: function( currentValue ){  |
  |       alert( 'the esc key was pressed!' ) |
  |     }                                     |
  |  }                                        |
  |                                           |
  +-------------------------------------------+
  ```

  Here are the events that we currently support along with the name of the
  attribute you would need to use on your field. To reiterate, you would use the
  attribute name like so:

  ```handlebars
    {{input attribute-name='controllerAction'}}
  ```

  ```
  +--------------------+----------------+
  |                    |                |
  | event              | attribute name |
  +--------------------+----------------+
  | new line inserted  | insert-newline |
  |                    |                |
  | enter key pressed  | insert-newline |
  |                    |                |
  | cancel key pressed | escape-press   |
  |                    |                |
  | focusin            | focus-in       |
  |                    |                |
  | focusout           | focus-out      |
  |                    |                |
  | keypress           | key-press      |
  |                    |                |
  | keyup              | key-up         |
  |                    |                |
