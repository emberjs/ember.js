/**
  An instance of `Ember.Application` is the starting point for every Ember
  application. It helps to instantiate, initialize and coordinate the many
  objects that make up your app.

  Each Ember app has one and only one `Ember.Application` object. In fact, the
  very first thing you should do in your application is create the instance:

  ```javascript
  window.App = Ember.Application.create();
  ```

  Typically, the application object is the only global variable. All other
  classes in your app should be properties on the `Ember.Application` instance,
  which highlights its first role: a global namespace.

  For example, if you define a view class, it might look like this:

  ```javascript
  App.MyView = Ember.View.extend();
  ```

  By default, calling `Ember.Application.create()` will automatically initialize
  your application by calling the `Ember.Application.initialize()` method. If
  you need to delay initialization, you can call your app's `deferReadiness()`
  method. When you are ready for your app to be initialized, call its
  `advanceReadiness()` method.

  You can define a `ready` method on the `Ember.Application` instance, which
  will be run by Ember when the application is initialized.

  Because `Ember.Application` inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes
  you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.
  See the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.

  While you can think of your `Ember.Application` as a container that holds the
  other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities
  going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand.

  ### Event Delegation

  Ember uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework
  to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to
  do it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own
  `mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`
  listener on the `body`.

  If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and
  start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking
  their `mouseDown` method as it goes.

  `Ember.Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as
  well as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For
  example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be
  called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.

  If there is a bubbling browser event that Ember does not listen for by
  default, you can specify custom events and their corresponding view method
  names by setting the application's `customEvents` property:

  ```javascript
  let App = Ember.Application.create({
    customEvents: {
      // add support for the paste event
      paste: 'paste'
    }
  });
  ```

  To prevent Ember from setting up a listener for a default event,
  specify the event name with a `null` value in the `customEvents`
  property:

  ```javascript
  let App = Ember.Application.create({
    customEvents: {
      // prevent listeners for mouseenter/mouseleave events
      mouseenter: null,
      mouseleave: null
    }
  });
  ```

  By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document
  body. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside
  an existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element
  inside the body.

  For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`
  should be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:

  ```javascript
  let App = Ember.Application.create({
    rootElement: '#ember-app'
  });
  ```

  The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a jQuery-compatible selector
  string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will
  not receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only
  append views inside it!

  To learn more about the events Ember components use, see
  [components/handling-events](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.6.0/components/handling-events/#toc_event-names).

  ### Initializers

  Libraries on top of Ember can add initializers, like so:

  ```javascript
  Ember.Application.initializer({
    name: 'api-adapter',

    initialize: function(application) {
      application.register('api-adapter:main', ApiAdapter);
    }
  });
  ```

  Initializers provide an opportunity to access the internal registry, which
  organizes the different components of an Ember application. Additionally
  they provide a chance to access the instantiated application. Beyond
  being used for libraries, initializers are also a great way to organize
  dependency injection or setup in your own application.

  ### Routing

  In addition to creating your application's router, `Ember.Application` is
  also responsible for telling the router when to start routing. Transitions
  between routes can be logged with the `LOG_TRANSITIONS` flag, and more
  detailed intra-transition logging can be logged with
  the `LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL` flag:

  ```javascript
  let App = Ember.Application.create({
    LOG_TRANSITIONS: true, // basic logging of successful transitions
    LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL: true // detailed logging of all routing steps
  });
  ```

  By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into
  application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you
  need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`
  method. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.

  If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a
  `ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing
  begins.

  @class Application
  @namespace Ember
  @extends Ember.Engine
  @uses RegistryProxyMixin
  @public
*/

const Application = Engine.extend({
  /**
    The root DOM element of the Application. This can be specified as an
    element or a
    [jQuery-compatible selector string](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/).

    This is the element that will be passed to the Application's,
    `eventDispatcher`, which sets up the listeners for event delegation. Every
    view in your application should be a child of the element you specify here.

    @property rootElement
    @type DOMElement
    @default 'body'

  rootElement: 'body',

    application's views.

    and sets up event listeners on the DOM element described by the
    application's `rootElement` property.

    See the documentation for `Ember.EventDispatcher` for more information.

    @property eventDispatcher
    @type Ember.EventDispatcher
    @default null
    @public
  */
  eventDispatcher: null,

  /**
    The DOM events for which the event dispatcher should listen.

    By default, the application's `Ember.EventDispatcher` listens
    for a set of standard DOM events, such as `mousedown` and
    `keyup`, and delegates them to your application's `Ember.View`
    instances.

    If you would like additional bubbling events to be delegated to your
    views, set your `Ember.Application`'s `customEvents` property
    to a hash containing the DOM event name as the key and the
    corresponding view method name as the value. Setting an event to
    a value of `null` will prevent a default event listener from being
    added for that event.

    To add new events to be listened to:

    ```javascript
    let App = Ember.Application.create({
      customEvents: {
        // add support for the paste event
        paste: 'paste'
      }
    });
    ```

    ```javascript
    let App = Ember.Application.create({
      customEvents: {
        // remove support for mouseenter / mouseleave events

    App.Router.map({

    This flag also exposes other internal APIs that assumes the existence of
    a special "default instance", like `App.__container__.lookup(...)`.

    This option is currently not configurable, its value is derived from
    the `autoboot` flag – disabling `autoboot` also implies opting-out of
    globals mode support, although they are ultimately orthogonal concerns.

    Some of the global modes features are already deprecated in 1.x. The
    existence of this flag is to untangle the globals mode code paths from
    the autoboot code paths, so that these legacy features can be reviewed
    for deprecation/removal separately.

    Forcing the (autoboot=true, _globalsMode=false) here and running the tests
    would reveal all the places where we are still relying on these legacy
    behavior internally (mostly just tests).

    3. Boot the instance by calling `instance.boot()`
    4. Invoke the `App.ready()` callback
    5. Kick-off routing on the instance

    Ideally, this is all we would need to do:

    ```javascript
    _autoBoot() {
      this.boot().then(() => {
        let instance = (this._globalsMode) ? this.__deprecatedInstance__ : this.buildInstance();

        instance.startRouting();
      });
    }
    ```

    Unfortunately, we cannot actually write this because we need to participate
    in the "synchronous" boot process. While the code above would work fine on
    the initial boot (i.e. DOM ready), when `App.reset()` is called, we need to
    boot a new instance synchronously (see the documentation on `_bootSync()`
    for details).

    Because of this restriction, the actual logic of this method is located
    inside `didBecomeReady()`.

    @method domReady
  */

      App.advanceReadiness();
    });
    ```

    This allows you to perform asynchronous setup logic and defer
    booting your application until the setup has finished.

    `Ember.ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` is an interface class that exists
    purely to document the available options; you do not need to construct it
    manually. Simply pass a regular JavaScript object containing of the
    desired options:

    ```javascript
    MyApp.visit("/", { location: "none", rootElement: "#container" });
    ```

    ### Supported Scenarios

    While the `BootOptions` class exposes a large number of knobs, not all
    combinations of them are valid; certain incompatible combinations might
    result in unexpected behavior.

    For example, booting the instance in the full browser environment
    while specifying a foriegn `document` object (e.g. `{ isBrowser: true,
    document: iframe.contentDocument }`) does not work correctly today,
    largely due to Ember's jQuery dependency.

    Currently, there are three officially supported scenarios/configurations.
    Usages outside of these scenarios are not guaranteed to work, but please
    feel free to file bug reports documenting your experience and any issues
    you encountered to help expand support.

    #### Browser Applications (Manual Boot)

    The setup is largely similar to how Ember works out-of-the-box. Normally,
    Ember will boot a default instance for your Application on "DOM ready".
    However, you can customize this behavior by disabling `autoboot`.

    For example, this allows you to render a miniture demo of your application
    into a specific area on your marketing website:

    ```javascript
    import MyApp from 'my-app';

    $(function() {
      let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });

      let options = {
        // Override the router's location adapter to prevent it from updating
        // the URL in the address bar
        location: 'none',

        // Override the default `rootElement` on the app to render into a
        // specific `div` on the page
        rootElement: '#demo'
      };

      // Start the app at the special demo URL
      App.visit('/demo', options);
    });
    ````

    Or perhaps you might want to boot two instances of your app on the same
    page for a split-screen multiplayer experience:

    ```javascript
    import MyApp from 'my-app';

    $(function() {
      let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });

      let sessionId = MyApp.generateSessionID();

      let player1 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+1&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#left', location: 'none' });
      let player2 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+2&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#right', location: 'none' });

      Promise.all([player1, player2]).then(() => {
        // Both apps have completed the initial render
        $('#loading').fadeOut();
      });
    });
    ```

    Do note that each app instance maintains their own registry/container, so
    they will run in complete isolation by default.

    #### Server-Side Rendering (also known as FastBoot)

    This setup allows you to run your Ember app in a server environment using
    Node.js and render its content into static HTML for SEO purposes.

    ```javascript
    const HTMLSerializer = new SimpleDOM.HTMLSerializer(SimpleDOM.voidMap);

    function renderURL(url) {
      let dom = new SimpleDOM.Document();
      let rootElement = dom.body;
      let options = { isBrowser: false, document: dom, rootElement: rootElement };

      return MyApp.visit(options).then(instance => {
        try {
          return HTMLSerializer.serialize(rootElement.firstChild);
        } finally {
          instance.destroy();
        }
      });
    }
    ```

    In this scenario, because Ember does not have access to a global `document`
    object in the Node.js environment, you must provide one explicitly. In practice,
    in the non-browser environment, the stand-in `document` object only need to
    implement a limited subset of the full DOM API. The `SimpleDOM` library is known
    to work.

    Since there is no access to jQuery in the non-browser environment, you must also
    specify a DOM `Element` object in the same `document` for the `rootElement` option
    (as opposed to a selector string like `"body"`).

    See the documentation on the `isBrowser`, `document` and `rootElement` properties
    on `Ember.ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.

    #### Server-Side Resource Discovery

    This setup allows you to run the routing layer of your Ember app in a server
    environment using Node.js and completely disable rendering. This allows you
    to simulate and discover the resources (i.e. AJAX requests) needed to fufill
    a given request and eagerly "push" these resources to the client.

    ```app/initializers/network-service.js
    import BrowserNetworkService from 'app/services/network/browser';
    import NodeNetworkService from 'app/services/network/node';

    // Inject a (hypothetical) service for abstracting all AJAX calls and use
    // the appropiate implementaion on the client/server. This also allows the
    // server to log all the AJAX calls made during a particular request and use
    // that for resource-discovery purpose.

    export function initialize(application) {
      if (window) { // browser
        application.register('service:network', BrowserNetworkService);
      } else { // node
        application.register('service:network', NodeNetworkService);
      }

      application.inject('route', 'network', 'service:network');
    };

    export default {
      name: 'network-service',
      initialize: initialize
    };
    ```

    ```app/routes/post.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    // An example of how the (hypothetical) service is used in routes.

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      model(params) {
        return this.network.fetch(`/api/posts/${params.post_id}.json`);
      },

      afterModel(post) {
        if (post.isExternalContent) {
          return this.network.fetch(`/api/external/?url=${post.externalURL}`);
        } else {
          return post;
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    ```javascript
    // Finally, put all the pieces together

    function discoverResourcesFor(url) {
      return MyApp.visit(url, { isBrowser: false, shouldRender: false }).then(instance => {
        let networkService = instance.lookup('service:network');
        return networkService.requests; // => { "/api/posts/123.json": "..." }
      });
    }
    ```
