/**
  An instance of `Ember.Application` is the starting point for every Ember
  application. It helps to instantiate, initialize and coordinate the many
  objects that make up your app.

  Each Ember app has one and only one `Ember.Application` object. In fact, the
  very first thing you should do in your application is create the instance:

  ```javascript
  window.App = Ember.Application.create();
  ```

  Typically, the application object is the only global variable. All other
  classes in your app should be properties on the `Ember.Application` instance,
  which highlights its first role: a global namespace.

  For example, if you define a view class, it might look like this:

  ```javascript
  App.MyView = Ember.View.extend();
  ```

  By default, calling `Ember.Application.create()` will automatically initialize
  your  application by calling the `Ember.Application.initialize()` method. If
  you need to delay initialization, you can call your app's `deferReadiness()`
  method. When you are ready for your app to be initialized, call its
  `advanceReadiness()` method.

  Because `Ember.Application` inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes
  you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.
  See the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.

  While you can think of your `Ember.Application` as a container that holds the
  other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities
  going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand.

  ### Event Delegation

  Ember uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework
  to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to
  do it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own
  `mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`
  listener on the `body`.

  If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and
  start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking
  their `mouseDown` method as it goes.

  `Ember.Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as
  well as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For
  example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be
  called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.

  If there is a browser event that Ember does not listen for by default, you
  can specify custom events and their corresponding view method names by
  setting the application's `customEvents` property:

  ```javascript
  App = Ember.Application.create({
    customEvents: {
      // add support for the loadedmetadata media
      // player event
      'loadedmetadata': "loadedMetadata"
    }
  });
  ```

  By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document
  body. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside
  an existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element
  inside the body.

  For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`
  should be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:

  ```javascript
  window.App = Ember.Application.create({
    rootElement: '#ember-app'
  });
  ```

  The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a jQuery-compatible selector
  string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will
  not receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only
  append views inside it!

  To learn more about the advantages of event delegation and the Ember view
  layer, and a list of the event listeners that are setup by default, visit the
  [Ember View Layer guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/view_layer#toc_event-delegation).

  ### Initializers

  Libraries on top of Ember can register additional initializers, like so:

  ```javascript
  Ember.Application.initializer({
    name: "store",

    initialize: function(container, application) {
      container.register('store', 'main', application.Store);
    }
  });
  ```

  ### Routing

  In addition to creating your application's router, `Ember.Application` is
  also responsible for telling the router when to start routing.

  By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into
  application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you
  need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`
  method. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.

  If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a
  `ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing
  begins:

  ```javascript
  window.App = Ember.Application.create({
    ready: function() {
      this.set('router.enableLogging', true);
    }
  });

  To begin routing, you must have at a minimum a top-level controller and view.
  You define these as `App.ApplicationController` and `App.ApplicationView`,
  respectively. Your application will not work if you do not define these two
  mandatory classes. For example:

  ```javascript
  App.ApplicationView = Ember.View.extend({
    templateName: 'application'
  });
  App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend();
  ```

  @class Application
  @namespace Ember
  @extends Ember.Namespace
*/
var Application = Ember.Application = Ember.Namespace.extend(
/** @scope Ember.Application.prototype */{

  /**
    The root DOM element of the Application. This can be specified as an
    element or a
    [jQuery-compatible selector string](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/).

    This is the element that will be passed to the Application's,
    `eventDispatcher`, which sets up the listeners for event delegation. Every
    view in your application should be a child of the element you specify here.

    @property rootElement
    @type DOMElement
    @default 'body'
  */
  rootElement: 'body',

  /**
    The `Ember.EventDispatcher` responsible for delegating events to this
    application's views.

    The event dispatcher is created by the application at initialization time
    and sets up event listeners on the DOM element described by the
    application's `rootElement` property.

    See the documentation for `Ember.EventDispatcher` for more information.

    @property eventDispatcher
    @type Ember.EventDispatcher
    @default null
  */
  eventDispatcher: null,

  /**
    The DOM events for which the event dispatcher should listen.

    By default, the application's `Ember.EventDispatcher` listens
    for a set of standard DOM events, such as `mousedown` and
    `keyup`, and delegates them to your application's `Ember.View`
    instances.

    If you would like additional events to be delegated to your
    views, set your `Ember.Application`'s `customEvents` property
    to a hash containing the DOM event name as the key and the
    corresponding view method name as the value. For example:

    ```javascript
    App = Ember.Application.create({
      customEvents: {
        // add support for the loadedmetadata media
        // player event
        'loadedmetadata': "loadedMetadata"
      }
    });
    ```

    @type Object
    @default null
  */
