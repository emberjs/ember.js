/**
  `Ember.Router` is the subclass of `Ember.StateManager` responsible for
  providing URL-based application state detection. The `Ember.Router` instance
  of an application detects the browser URL at application load time and
  attempts to match it to a specific application state. Additionally the router
  will update the URL to reflect an application's state changes over time.

  ## Adding a Router Instance to Your Application

  An instance of `Ember.Router` can be associated with an instance of
  `Ember.Application` in one of two ways:

  You can provide a subclass of `Ember.Router` as the `Router` property of your
  application. An instance of this `Router` class will be instantiated and
  route detection will be enabled when the application's `initialize` method is
  called. The `Router` instance will be available as the `router` property of
  the application:

  ```javascript
  App = Ember.Application.create({
    Router: Ember.Router.extend({ ... })
  });

  App.initialize();
  App.get('router') // an instance of App.Router
  ```

  If you want to define a `Router` instance elsewhere, you can pass the
  instance to the application's `initialize` method:

  ```javascript
  App = Ember.Application.create();
  aRouter = Ember.Router.create({ ... });

  App.initialize(aRouter);
  App.get('router') // aRouter
  ```

  ## Adding Routes to a Router

  The `initialState` property of `Ember.Router` instances is named `root`. The
  state stored in this property must be a subclass of `Ember.Route`. The `root`
  route acts as the container for the set of routable states but is not
  routable itself. It should have states that are also subclasses of
  `Ember.Route` which each have a `route` property describing the URL pattern
  you would like to detect.

  ```javascript
  App = Ember.Application.create({
    Router: Ember.Router.extend({
      root: Ember.Route.extend({
        index: Ember.Route.extend({
          route: '/'
        }),
        ... additional Ember.Routes ...
      })
    })
  });
  App.initialize();
  ```

  When an application loads, Ember will parse the URL and attempt to find an
  Ember.Route within the application's states that matches. (The example
  URL-matching below will use the default 'hash syntax' provided by
  `Ember.HashLocation`.)

  In the following route structure:

  ```javascript
  App = Ember.Application.create({
    Router: Ember.Router.extend({
      root: Ember.Route.extend({
        aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({
          route: '/'
        }),
        bRoute: Ember.Route.extend({
          route: '/alphabeta'
        })
      })
    })
  });
  App.initialize();
  ```

  Loading the page at the URL '#/' will detect the route property of
  `root.aRoute` ('/') and transition the router first to the state named `root`
  and then to the substate `aRoute`.

  Respectively, loading the page at the URL '#/alphabeta' would detect the
  route property of `root.bRoute` ('/alphabeta') and transition the router
  first to the state named `root` and then to the substate `bRoute`.

  ## Adding Nested Routes to a Router

  Routes can contain nested subroutes each with their own `route` property
  describing the nested portion of the URL they would like to detect and
  handle. `Router`, like all instances of `StateManager`, cannot call
  `transitonTo` with an intermediary state. To avoid transitioning the Router
  into an intermediary state when detecting URLs, a Route with nested routes
  must define both a base `route` property for itself and a child Route with a
  `route` property of `'/'` which will be transitioned to when the base route
  is detected in the URL:

  Given the following application code:

  ```javascript
  App = Ember.Application.create({
    Router: Ember.Router.extend({
      root: Ember.Route.extend({
        aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({
          route: '/theBaseRouteForThisSet',

          indexSubRoute: Ember.Route.extend({
            route: '/'
          }),

          subRouteOne: Ember.Route.extend({
            route: '/subroute1'
          }),

          subRouteTwo: Ember.Route.extend({
            route: '/subRoute2'
          })

        })
      })
    })
  });
  App.initialize();
  ```

  When the application is loaded at '/theBaseRouteForThisSet' the Router will
  transition to the route at path `root.aRoute` and then transition to state
  `indexSubRoute`.

  When the application is loaded at '/theBaseRouteForThisSet/subRoute1' the
  Router will transition to the route at path `root.aRoute` and then transition
  to state `subRouteOne`.

  ## Route Transition Events

  Transitioning between `Ember.Route` instances (including the transition into
  the detected route when loading the application) triggers the same
  transition events as state transitions for base `Ember.State`s. However, the
  default `setup` transition event is named `connectOutlets` on `Ember.Router`
  instances (see 'Changing View Hierarchy in Response To State Change').

  The following route structure when loaded with the URL "#/"

  ```javascript
  App = Ember.Application.create({
    Router: Ember.Router.extend({
      root: Ember.Route.extend({
        aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({
          route: '/',
          enter: function(router) {
            console.log("entering root.aRoute from", router.get('currentState.name'));
          },
          connectOutlets: function(router) {
            console.log("entered root.aRoute, fully transitioned to", router.get('currentState.path'));
          }
        })
      })
    })
  });
  App.initialize();
  ```

  Will result in console output of:

  ```
  'entering root.aRoute from root'
  'entered root.aRoute, fully transitioned to root.aRoute '
  ```

  `Ember.Route` has two additional callbacks for handling URL serialization and
  deserialization. See 'Serializing/Deserializing URLs'

  ## Routes With Dynamic Segments

  An `Ember.Route`'s `route` property can reference dynamic sections of the URL
  by prefacing a URL segment with the ':' character. The values of these
  dynamic segments will be passed as a hash to the `deserialize` method of the
  matching `Route` (see 'Serializing/Deserializing URLs').

  ## Serializing/Deserializing URLs

  `Ember.Route` has two callbacks for associating a particular object context
  with a URL: `serialize` for converting an object into a parameters hash to
  fill dynamic segments of a URL and `deserialize` for converting a hash of
  dynamic segments from the URL into the appropriate object.

  ### Deserializing A URL's Dynamic Segments

  When an application is first loaded or the URL is changed manually (e.g.
  through the browser's back button) the `deserialize` method of the URL's
  matching `Ember.Route` will be called with the application's router as its
  first argument and a hash of the URL's dynamic segments and values as its
  second argument.

  The following route structure when loaded with the URL 
  "#/fixed/thefirstvalue/anotherFixed/thesecondvalue":

  ```javascript
  App = Ember.Application.create({
    Router: Ember.Router.extend({
      root: Ember.Route.extend({
        aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({
          route: '/fixed/:dynamicSectionA/anotherFixed/:dynamicSectionB',
          deserialize: function(router, params) {}
        })
      })
    })
  });
  App.initialize();
  ```

  Will call the `deserialize` method of the Route instance at the path
  `root.aRoute` with the following hash as its second argument:

  ```javascript
  {
    dynamicSectionA: 'thefirstvalue',
    dynamicSectionB: 'thesecondvalue'
  }
  ```

  Within `deserialize` you should use this information to retrieve or create an
  appropriate context object for the given URL (e.g. by loading from a remote
      API or accessing the browser's `localStorage`). This object must be the
  `return` value of `deserialize` and will be passed to the `Route`'s
  `connectOutlets` and `serialize` methods.

  When an application's state is changed from within the application itself,
  the context provided for the transition will be passed and `deserialize` is
  not called (see 'Transitions Between States').

  ### Serializing An Object For URLs with Dynamic Segments

  When transitioning into a Route whose `route` property contains dynamic
  segments the route's `serialize` method is called with the route's router as
  the first argument and the route's context as the second argument. The return
  value of `serialize` will be used to populate the dynamic segments and should
  be an object with keys that match the names of the dynamic sections.

  Given the following route structure:

  ```javascript
  App = Ember.Application.create({
    Router: Ember.Router.extend({
      root: Ember.Route.extend({
        aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({
          route: '/'
        }),
        bRoute: Ember.Route.extend({
          route: '/staticSection/:someDynamicSegment',
          serialize: function(router, context) {
            return {
              someDynamicSegment: context.get('name')
            }
          }
        })
      })
    })
  });
  App.initialize();
  ```

  Transitioning to `root.bRoute` with a context of 
  `Object.create({name: 'Yehuda'})` will call the `Route`'s `serialize` 
  method with the context as its second argument and update the URL to
  '#/staticSection/Yehuda'.

  ## Transitions Between States

  Once a routed application has initialized its state based on the entry URL,
  subsequent transitions to other states will update the URL if the entered
  Route has a `route` property. Given the following route structure loaded at
  the URL '#/':

  ```javascript
  App = Ember.Application.create({
    Router: Ember.Router.extend({
      root: Ember.Route.extend({
        aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({
          route: '/',
          moveElsewhere: Ember.Route.transitionTo('bRoute')
        }),
        bRoute: Ember.Route.extend({
          route: '/someOtherLocation'
        })
      })
    })
  });
  App.initialize();
  ```

  And application code:

  ```javascript
  App.get('router').send('moveElsewhere');
  ```

  Will transition the application's state to `root.bRoute` and trigger an
  update of the URL to `#/someOtherLocation`.

  For URL patterns with dynamic segments a context can be supplied as the
  second argument to `send`. The router will match dynamic segments names to
  keys on this object and fill in the URL with the supplied values. Given the
  following state structure loaded at the URL `#/`:

  ```javascript
  App = Ember.Application.create({
    Router: Ember.Router.extend({
      root: Ember.Route.extend({
        aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({
          route: '/',
          moveElsewhere: Ember.Route.transitionTo('bRoute')
        }),
        bRoute: Ember.Route.extend({
          route: '/a/route/:dynamicSection/:anotherDynamicSection',
          connectOutlets: function(router, context) {},
        })
      })
    })
  });
  App.initialize();
  ```

  And application code:

  ```javascript
  App.get('router').send('moveElsewhere', {
    dynamicSection: '42',
    anotherDynamicSection: 'Life'
  });
  ```

  Will transition the application's state to `root.bRoute` and trigger an
  update of the URL to `#/a/route/42/Life`.

  The context argument will also be passed as the second argument to the
  `serialize` method call.

  ## Injection of Controller Singletons

  During application initialization Ember will detect properties of the
  application ending in 'Controller', create singleton instances of each class,
  and assign them as properties on the router. The property name will be the
  UpperCamel name converted to lowerCamel format. These controller classes
  should be subclasses of `Ember.ObjectController`, `Ember.ArrayController`,
  `Ember.Controller`, or a custom `Ember.Object` that includes the
  `Ember.ControllerMixin` mixin.

  ```javascript
  App = Ember.Application.create({
    FooController: Ember.Object.create(Ember.ControllerMixin),
    Router: Ember.Router.extend({ ... })
  });

  App.get('router.fooController'); // instance of App.FooController
  ```

  The controller singletons will have their `namespace` property set to the
  application and their `target` property set to the application's router
  singleton for easy integration with Ember's user event system. See 'Changing
  View Hierarchy in Response To State Change' and 'Responding to User-initiated
  Events.'

  ## Responding to User-initiated Events

  Controller instances injected into the router at application initialization
  have their `target` property set to the application's router instance. These
  controllers will also be the default `context` for their associated views.
  Uses of the `{{action}}` helper will automatically target the application's
  router.

  Given the following application entered at the URL `#/`:

  ```javascript
  App = Ember.Application.create({
    Router: Ember.Router.extend({
      root: Ember.Route.extend({
        aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({
          route: '/',
          anActionOnTheRouter: function(router, context) {
            router.transitionTo('anotherState', context);
          }
        })
        anotherState: Ember.Route.extend({
          route: '/differentUrl',
          connectOutlets: function(router, context) {

          }
        })
      })
    })
  });
  App.initialize();
  ```

  The following template:

  ```html
  <script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="aView">
      <h1><a {{action anActionOnTheRouter}}>{{title}}</a></h1>
  </script>
  ```

  Will delegate `click` events on the rendered `h1` to the application's router
  instance. In this case the `anActionOnTheRouter` method of the state at
  'root.aRoute' will be called with the view's controller as the context
  argument. This context will be passed to the `connectOutlets` as its second
  argument.

  Different `context` can be supplied from within the `{{action}}` helper,
  allowing specific context passing between application states:

  ```html
  <script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="photos">
    {{#each photo in controller}}
      <h1><a {{action showPhoto photo}}>{{title}}</a></h1>
    {{/each}}
  </script>
  ```

  See `Handlebars.helpers.action` for additional usage examples.

  ## Changing View Hierarchy in Response To State Change

  Changes in application state that change the URL should be accompanied by
  associated changes in view hierarchy. This can be accomplished by calling
  `connectOutlet` on the injected controller singletons from within the
  'connectOutlets' event of an `Ember.Route`:

  ```javascript
  App = Ember.Application.create({
    OneController: Ember.ObjectController.extend(),
    OneView: Ember.View.extend(),

    AnotherController: Ember.ObjectController.extend(),
    AnotherView: Ember.View.extend(),

    Router: Ember.Router.extend({
      root: Ember.Route.extend({
        aRoute: Ember.Route.extend({
          route: '/',
          connectOutlets: function(router, context) {
            router.get('oneController').connectOutlet('another');
          },
        })
      })
    })
  });
  App.initialize();
  ```

  This will detect the `{{outlet}}` portion of `oneController`'s view (an
  instance of `App.OneView`) and fill it with a rendered instance of
  `App.AnotherView` whose `context` will be the single instance of
  `App.AnotherController` stored on the router in the `anotherController`
  property.

  `Ember.Controller.connectOutlet`. For more information on controller
  injections, see `Ember.Application#initialize()`. For additional information
