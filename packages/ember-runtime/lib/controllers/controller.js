/**
  `Ember.ControllerMixin` provides a standard interface for all classes that
  compose Ember's controller layer: `Ember.Controller`,
  `Ember.ArrayController`, and `Ember.ObjectController`.

  Within an `Ember.Router`-managed application single shared instaces of every
  Controller object in your application's namespace will be added to the
  application's `Ember.Router` instance. See `Ember.Application#initialize`
  for additional information.

  ## Views

  By default a controller instance will be the rendering context
  for its associated `Ember.View.` This connection is made during calls to
  `Ember.ControllerMixin#connectOutlet`.

  Within the view's template, the `Ember.View` instance can be accessed
  through the controller with `{{view}}`.

  ## Target Forwarding

  By default a controller will target your application's `Ember.Router`
  instance. Calls to `{{action}}` within the template of a controller's view
  are forwarded to the router. See `Ember.Handlebars.helpers.action` for
  additional information.

    The object to which events from the view should be sent.

    For example, when a Handlebars template uses the `{{action}}` helper,
    it will attempt to send the event to the view's controller's `target`.

    By default, a controller's `target` is set to the router after it is
    instantiated by `Ember.Application#initialize`.
