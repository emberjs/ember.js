/**
  The ControllerContentModelAliasDeprecation mixin is used to provide a useful
  deprecation warning when specifying `content` directly on a `Ember.Controller`
  (without also specifying `model`).

  Ember versions prior to 1.7 used `model` as an alias of `content`, but due to
  much confusion this alias was reversed (so `content` is now an alias of `model).

  This change reduces many caveats with model/content, and also sets a
  simple ground rule: Never set a controllers content, rather always set
  its model and ember will do the right thing.


  `Ember.ControllerContentModelAliasDeprecation` is used internally by Ember in
  `Ember.Controller`.

    Moves `content` to `model`  at extend time if a `model` is not also specified.

    Note that this currently modifies the mixin themselves, which is technically
    dubious but is practically of little consequence. This may change in the
    future.

    if (props.content && !modelSpecified) {
      props.model = props.content;

      Ember.deprecate('Do not specify `content` on a Controller, use `model` instead.', false);
    }
