/**
  The `Ember.ActionHandler` mixin implements support for moving an `actions`
  property to an `_actions` property at extend time, and adding `_actions`
  to the object's mergedProperties list.

  `Ember.ActionHandler` is used internally by Ember in  `Ember.View`,
  `Ember.Controller`, and `Ember.Route`.

  @class ActionHandler
  @namespace Ember
*/
Ember.ActionHandler = Ember.Mixin.create({
  mergedProperties: ['_actions'],

  /**
    The collection of functions, keyed by name, available on this route as
    action targets.

    These functions will be invoked when a matching `{{action}}` is triggered
    from within a template and the application's current route is this route.

    Actions can also be invoked from other parts of your application via `Route#send`
    or `Controller#send`.

    The `actions` hash will inherit action handlers from
    the `actions` hash defined on extended Route parent classes
    or mixins rather than just replace the entire hash, e.g.:

    ```js
    App.CanDisplayBanner = Ember.Mixin.create({
      actions: {
        displayBanner: function(msg) {
          // ...
        }
      }
    });

    App.WelcomeRoute = Ember.Route.extend(App.CanDisplayBanner, {
      actions: {
        playMusic: function() {
          // ...
        }
      }
    });

    // `WelcomeRoute`, when active, will be able to respond
    // to both actions, since the actions hash is merged rather
    // then replaced when extending mixins / parent classes.
    this.send('displayBanner');
    this.send('playMusic');
    ```

    Within a route's action handler, the value of the `this` context
    is the Route object:

    ```js
    App.SongRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        myAction: function() {
          this.controllerFor("song");
          this.transitionTo("other.route");
          ...
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    It is also possible to call `this._super()` from within an
    action handler if it overrides a handler defined on a parent
    class or mixin:

    Take for example the following routes:

    ```js
    App.DebugRoute = Ember.Mixin.create({
      actions: {
        debugRouteInformation: function() {
          console.debug("trololo");
        }
      }
    });

    App.AnnoyingDebugRoute = Ember.Route.extend(App.DebugRoute, {
      actions: {
        debugRouteInformation: function() {
          // also call the debugRouteInformation of mixed in App.DebugRoute
          this._super();

          // show additional annoyance
          window.alert(...);
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    ## Bubbling

    By default, an action will stop bubbling once a handler defined
    on the `actions` hash handles it. To continue bubbling the action,
    you must return `true` from the handler:

    ```js
    App.Router.map(function() {
      this.resource("album", function() {
        this.route("song");
      });
    });

    App.AlbumRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        startPlaying: function() {
        }
      }
    });

    App.AlbumSongRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        startPlaying: function() {
          // ...

          if (actionShouldAlsoBeTriggeredOnParentRoute) {
            return true;
          }
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    ## Built-in actions

    There are a few built-in actions pertaining to transitions that you
    can use to customize transition behavior: `willTransition` and
    `error`.

    ### `willTransition`

    The `willTransition` action is fired at the beginning of any
    attempted transition with a `Transition` object as the sole
    argument. This action can be used for aborting, redirecting,
    or decorating the transition from the currently active routes.

    A good example is preventing navigation when a form is
    half-filled out:

    ```js
    App.ContactFormRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        willTransition: function(transition) {
          if (this.controller.get('userHasEnteredData')) {
            this.controller.displayNavigationConfirm();
            transition.abort();
          }
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    You can also redirect elsewhere by calling
    `this.transitionTo('elsewhere')` from within `willTransition`.
    Note that `willTransition` will not be fired for the
    redirecting `transitionTo`, since `willTransition` doesn't
    fire when there is already a transition underway. If you want
    subsequent `willTransition` actions to fire for the redirecting
    transition, you must first explicitly call
    `transition.abort()`.

    ### `error`

    When attempting to transition into a route, any of the hooks
    may return a promise that rejects, at which point an `error`
    action will be fired on the partially-entered routes, allowing
    for per-route error handling logic, or shared error handling
    logic defined on a parent route.

    Here is an example of an error handler that will be invoked
    for rejected promises from the various hooks on the route,
    as well as any unhandled errors from child routes:

    ```js
    App.AdminRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      beforeModel: function() {
        return Ember.RSVP.reject("bad things!");
      },

      actions: {
        error: function(error, transition) {
          // Assuming we got here due to the error in `beforeModel`,
          // we can expect that error === "bad things!",
          // but a promise model rejecting would also
          // call this hook, as would any errors encountered
          // in `afterModel`.

          // The `error` hook is also provided the failed
          // `transition`, which can be stored and later
          // `.retry()`d if desired.

          this.transitionTo('login');
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    `error` actions that bubble up all the way to `ApplicationRoute`
    will fire a default error handler that logs the error. You can
    specify your own global default error handler by overriding the
    `error` handler on `ApplicationRoute`:

    ```js
    App.ApplicationRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
      actions: {
        error: function(error, transition) {
          this.controllerFor('banner').displayError(error.message);
        }
      }
    });
    ```
