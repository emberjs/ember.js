    The object to which actions from the view should be sent.

    For example, when a Handlebars template uses the `{{action}}` helper,
    it will attempt to send the action to the view's controller's `target`.

    By default, the value of the target property is set to the router, and
    is injected when a controller is instantiated. This injection is defined
    in Ember.Application#buildContainer, and is applied as part of the
    applications initialization process. It can also be set after a controller
    has been instantiated, for instance when using the render helper in a
    template, or when a controller is used as an `itemController`. In most
    cases the `target` property will automatically be set to the logical
    consumer of actions for the controller.
