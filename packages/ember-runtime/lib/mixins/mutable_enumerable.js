/**
  @class

  This mixin defines the API for modifying generic enumerables.  These methods
  can be applied to an object regardless of whether it is ordered or 
  unordered.
  
  Note that an Enumerable can change even if it does not implement this mixin.
  For example, a MappedEnumerable cannot be directly modified but if its 
  underlying enumerable changes, it will change also.

  ## Adding Objects
  
  To add an object to an enumerable, use the addObject() method.  This 
  method will only add the object to the enumerable if the object is not 
  already present and the object if of a type supported by the enumerable.
  
      javascript:
      set.addObject(contact);
      
  ## Removing Objects
  
  To remove an object form an enumerable, use the removeObject() method.  This
  will only remove the object if it is already in the enumerable, otherwise
  this method has no effect.
  
      javascript:
      set.removeObject(contact);
      
  ## Implementing In Your Own Code
  
  If you are implementing an object and want to support this API, just include
  this mixin in your class and implement the required methods.  In your unit
  tests, be sure to apply the Ember.MutableEnumerableTests to your object.
