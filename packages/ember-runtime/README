== About Ember Runtime

The Ember Runtime is a library that adds property bindings and observers 
to JavaScript.  You can use the runtime in web pages, applications, and 
everything in between to easily manage the state of your page with less code.

This library is a part of the Ember JavaScript Application Framework,
which is a full-stack MVC framework for building desktop-like applications on
the web.
