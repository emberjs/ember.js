/**
  An `Ember.Binding` connects the properties of two objects so that whenever
  the value of one property changes, the other property will be changed also.

  ## Automatic Creation of Bindings with `/^*Binding/`-named Properties

  You do not usually create Binding objects directly but instead describe
  bindings in your class or object definition using automatic binding
  detection.

  Properties ending in a `Binding` suffix will be converted to `Ember.Binding`
  instances. The value of this property should be a string representing a path
  to another object or a custom binding instanced created using Binding helpers
  (see "One Way Bindings"):

  ```
  valueBinding: "MyApp.someController.title"
  ```

  This will create a binding from `MyApp.someController.title` to the `value`
  property of your object instance automatically. Now the two values will be
  kept in sync.

  ## One Way Bindings

  One especially useful binding customization you can use is the `oneWay()`
  helper. This helper tells Ember that you are only interested in
  receiving changes on the object you are binding from. For example, if you
  are binding to a preference and you want to be notified if the preference
  has changed, but your object will not be changing the preference itself, you
  could do:

  ```
  bigTitlesBinding: Ember.Binding.oneWay("MyApp.preferencesController.bigTitles")
  ```

  This way if the value of `MyApp.preferencesController.bigTitles` changes the
  `bigTitles` property of your object will change also. However, if you
  change the value of your `bigTitles` property, it will not update the
  `preferencesController`.

  One way bindings are almost twice as fast to setup and twice as fast to
  execute because the binding only has to worry about changes to one side.

  You should consider using one way bindings anytime you have an object that
  may be created frequently and you do not intend to change a property; only
  to monitor it for changes (such as in the example above).

  ## Adding Bindings Manually

  All of the examples above show you how to configure a custom binding, but the
  result of these customizations will be a binding template, not a fully active
  Binding instance. The binding will actually become active only when you
  instantiate the object the binding belongs to. It is useful however, to
  understand what actually happens when the binding is activated.

  For a binding to function it must have at least a `from` property and a `to`
  property. The `from` property path points to the object/key that you want to
  bind from while the `to` path points to the object/key you want to bind to.

  When you define a custom binding, you are usually describing the property
  you want to bind from (such as `MyApp.someController.value` in the examples
  above). When your object is created, it will automatically assign the value
  you want to bind `to` based on the name of your binding key. In the
  examples above, during init, Ember objects will effectively call
  something like this on your binding:

  ```javascript
  binding = Ember.Binding.from(this.valueBinding).to("value");
  ```

  This creates a new binding instance based on the template you provide, and
  sets the to path to the `value` property of the new object. Now that the
  binding is fully configured with a `from` and a `to`, it simply needs to be
  connected to become active. This is done through the `connect()` method:

  ```javascript
  binding.connect(this);
  ```

  Note that when you connect a binding you pass the object you want it to be
  connected to. This object will be used as the root for both the from and
  to side of the binding when inspecting relative paths. This allows the
  binding to be automatically inherited by subclassed objects as well.

  Now that the binding is connected, it will observe both the from and to side
  and relay changes.

  If you ever needed to do so (you almost never will, but it is useful to
  understand this anyway), you could manually create an active binding by
  using the `Ember.bind()` helper method. (This is the same method used by
  to setup your bindings on objects):

  ```javascript
  Ember.bind(MyApp.anotherObject, "value", "MyApp.someController.value");
  ```

  Both of these code fragments have the same effect as doing the most friendly
  form of binding creation like so:

  ```javascript
  MyApp.anotherObject = Ember.Object.create({
    valueBinding: "MyApp.someController.value",

    // OTHER CODE FOR THIS OBJECT...
  });
  ```

  Ember's built in binding creation method makes it easy to automatically
  create bindings for you. You should always use the highest-level APIs
  available, even if you understand how it works underneath.
