/**
  An instance of `Ember.Application` is the starting point for every Ember
  application. It helps to instantiate, initialize and coordinate the many
  objects that make up your app.

  Each Ember app has one and only one `Ember.Application` object. In fact, the
  very first thing you should do in your application is create the instance:

  ```javascript
  window.App = Ember.Application.create();
  ```

  Typically, the application object is the only global variable. All other
  classes in your app should be properties on the `Ember.Application` instance,
  which highlights its first role: a global namespace.

  For example, if you define a view class, it might look like this:

  ```javascript
  App.MyView = Ember.View.extend();
  ```

  By default, calling `Ember.Application.create()` will automatically initialize
  your application by calling the `Ember.Application.initialize()` method. If
  you need to delay initialization, you can call your app's `deferReadiness()`
  method. When you are ready for your app to be initialized, call its
  `advanceReadiness()` method.

  You can define a `ready` method on the `Ember.Application` instance, which
  will be run by Ember when the application is initialized.

  Because `Ember.Application` inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes
  you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.
  See the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.

  While you can think of your `Ember.Application` as a container that holds the
  other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities
  going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand.

  ### Event Delegation

  Ember uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework
  to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to
  do it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own
  `mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`
  listener on the `body`.

  If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and
  start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking
  their `mouseDown` method as it goes.

  `Ember.Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as
  well as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For
  example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be
  called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.

  If there is a bubbling browser event that Ember does not listen for by
  default, you can specify custom events and their corresponding view method
  names by setting the application's `customEvents` property:

  ```javascript
  App = Ember.Application.create({
    customEvents: {
      // add support for the paste event
      paste: "paste"
    }
  });
  ```

  By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document
  body. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside
  an existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element
  inside the body.

  For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`
  should be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:

  ```javascript
  window.App = Ember.Application.create({
    rootElement: '#ember-app'
  });
  ```

  The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a jQuery-compatible selector
  string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will
  not receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only
  append views inside it!

  To learn more about the advantages of event delegation and the Ember view
  layer, and a list of the event listeners that are setup by default, visit the
  [Ember View Layer guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/understanding-ember/the-view-layer/#toc_event-delegation).

  ### Initializers

  Libraries on top of Ember can add initializers, like so:

  ```javascript
  Ember.Application.initializer({
    name: 'api-adapter',

    initialize: function(container, application) {
      application.register('api-adapter:main', ApiAdapter);
    }
  });
  ```

  Initializers provide an opportunity to access the container, which
  organizes the different components of an Ember application. Additionally
  they provide a chance to access the instantiated application. Beyond
  being used for libraries, initializers are also a great way to organize
  dependency injection or setup in your own application.

  ### Routing

  In addition to creating your application's router, `Ember.Application` is
  also responsible for telling the router when to start routing. Transitions
  between routes can be logged with the `LOG_TRANSITIONS` flag, and more
  detailed intra-transition logging can be logged with
  the `LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL` flag:

  ```javascript
  window.App = Ember.Application.create({
    LOG_TRANSITIONS: true, // basic logging of successful transitions
    LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL: true // detailed logging of all routing steps
  });
  ```

  By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into
  application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you
  need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`
  method. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.

  If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a
  `ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing
  begins.
  ```

  @class Application
  @namespace Ember
  @extends Ember.Namespace
*/

var Application = Namespace.extend(DeferredMixin, {

  /**
    The root DOM element of the Application. This can be specified as an
    element or a

    `eventDispatcher`, which sets up the listeners for event delegation. Every
    view in your application should be a child of the element you specify here.

    application's `rootElement` property.

    See the documentation for `Ember.EventDispatcher` for more information.

    for a set of standard DOM events, such as `mousedown` and
    `keyup`, and delegates them to your application's `Ember.View`
    instances.

    If you would like additional bubbling events to be delegated to your
    views, set your `Ember.Application`'s `customEvents` property
    to a hash containing the DOM event name as the key and the
    corresponding view method name as the value. For example:

    ```javascript
    App = Ember.Application.create({
      customEvents: {
        // add support for the paste event
        paste: "paste"
      }

  /**
    Registers a factory that can be used for dependency injection (with
    `App.inject`) or for service lookup. Each factory is registered with
    a full name including two parts: `type:name`.

    A simple example:

    ```javascript
    var App = Ember.Application.create();
    App.Orange  = Ember.Object.extend();
    App.register('fruit:favorite', App.Orange);
    ```

    Ember will resolve factories from the `App` namespace automatically.
    For example `App.CarsController` will be discovered and returned if
    an application requests `controller:cars`.

    An example of registering a controller with a non-standard name:

    ```javascript
    var App = Ember.Application.create(),
        Session  = Ember.Controller.extend();

    App.register('controller:session', Session);

    // The Session controller can now be treated like a normal controller,
    // despite its non-standard name.
    App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({
      needs: ['session']
    });
    ```

    Registered factories are **instantiated** by having `create`
    called on them. Additionally they are **singletons**, each time
    they are looked up they return the same instance.

    Some examples modifying that default behavior:

    ```javascript
    var App = Ember.Application.create();

    App.Person  = Ember.Object.extend();
    App.Orange  = Ember.Object.extend();
    App.Email   = Ember.Object.extend();
    App.session = Ember.Object.create();

    App.register('model:user', App.Person, {singleton: false });
    App.register('fruit:favorite', App.Orange);
    App.register('communication:main', App.Email, {singleton: false});
    App.register('session', App.session, {instantiate: false});
    ```

    @method register
    @param  fullName {String} type:name (e.g., 'model:user')
    @param  factory {Function} (e.g., App.Person)
    @param  options {Object} (optional) disable instantiation or singleton usage
  **/
  register: function() {
    var container = this.__container__;
    container.register.apply(container, arguments);
  },

  /**
    Define a dependency injection onto a specific factory or all factories
    of a type.

    When Ember instantiates a controller, view, or other framework component
    it can attach a dependency to that component. This is often used to
    provide services to a set of framework components.

    An example of providing a session object to all controllers:

    ```javascript
    var App = Ember.Application.create(),
        Session = Ember.Object.extend({ isAuthenticated: false });

    // A factory must be registered before it can be injected
    App.register('session:main', Session);

    // Inject 'session:main' onto all factories of the type 'controller'
    // with the name 'session'
    App.inject('controller', 'session', 'session:main');

    App.IndexController = Ember.Controller.extend({
      isLoggedIn: Ember.computed.alias('session.isAuthenticated')
    });
    ```

    Injections can also be performed on specific factories.

    ```javascript
    App.inject(<full_name or type>, <property name>, <full_name>)
    App.inject('route', 'source', 'source:main')
    App.inject('route:application', 'email', 'model:email')
    ```

    It is important to note that injections can only be performed on
    classes that are instantiated by Ember itself. Instantiating a class
    directly (via `create` or `new`) bypasses the dependency injection
    system.

    Ember-Data instantiates its models in a unique manner, and consequently
    injections onto models (or all models) will not work as expected. Injections
    on models can be enabled by setting `Ember.MODEL_FACTORY_INJECTIONS`
    to `true`.

    @method inject
    @param  factoryNameOrType {String}
    @param  property {String}

    4. Re-route to the existing url

    test("first test", function() {
      // App is again freshly reset
    });
    ```

    Advanced Example:

    Occasionally you may want to prevent the app from initializing during
    setup. This could enable extra configuration, or enable asserting prior
    to the app becoming ready.

    ```javascript

    var App;

    run(function() {

    });

    module("acceptance test", {

/**
  This function defines the default lookup rules for container lookups:

  * templates are looked up on `Ember.TEMPLATES`
  * other names are looked up on the application after classifying the name.
    For example, `controller:post` looks up `App.PostController` by default.
  * if the default lookup fails, look for registered classes on the container

  This allows the application to register default injections in the container
  that could be overridden by the normal naming convention.
