# How to Run Unit Tests

1. Install Ruby and Rubygems. There are many resources on the web can help you to do so, one of the best ways may be [rvm](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/).

2. Install spade. Follow instructions on [its project page](http://github.com/strobecorp/spade).

3. Install sproutcore-preprocessor via `spade install sproutcore-preprocessor`.

3. Enter the following commands in your command shell:

        cd sproutcore20
        spade update
        spade preview
    
4. Then visit: http://localhost:4020/tests.html?package=PACKAGE_NAME.  Replace 'PACKAGE_NAME' with the name of the package you want to run.  For example:

  * [SproutCore Runtime](http://localhost:4020/tests.html?package=sproutcore-runtime)
  * [SproutCore Views](http://localhost:4020/tests.html?package=sproutcore-views)
  * [SproutCore DataStore](http://localhost:4020/tests.html?package=sproutcore-datastore)
  * [SproutCore Handlebars](http://localhost:4020/tests.html?package=sproutcore-handlebars)
  
# Adding New Packages

Be sure you include the new package as a dependency in the global `package.json` and run `spade update`.

Note that unless you are adding new __tests__ or adding a new package you should not need to run `spade update`.
