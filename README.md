Ember.js is a Javascript framework that greatly reduces the time, effort and resources needed
to build any web application. It is focused on making you, the developer, as productive as possible by doing all the common, repetitive, yet essential, tasks involved in most web development projects. 

Ember.js also provides access to the most advanced features of Javascript, HTML and the Browser giving you everything you need to create your next killer web app.

# Building Ember.js

1. Ensure that [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) are installed.
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js.git && cd ember.js`.
3. Run `git config core.symlinks true` to ensure that symlinks are enabled.
4. Run `git reset --hard HEAD` to reset to HEAD with symlinks.
5. Run `npm install` to ensure the required dependencies are installed.
6. Run `bower install` to ensure required web dependencies are installed.
7. Run `npm run build` to build Ember.js. The builds will be placed in the `dist/` directory.

If you edit the `feature.json` file, you may also need to clear the async disk
cache to get a proper build:

```js
rm -rf tmp $TMPDIR/async-disk-cache/
```

## npm install troubleshooting

If you encounter a problem with downloading dependencies like:

```
npm ERR! registry error parsing json
```

consider upgrading `npm` with:

```
npm install -g npm@latest
```

You can find more information in [Upgrading on *nix (OSX, Linux, etc.)](https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Troubleshooting#upgrading-on-nix-osx-linux-etc) npm wiki page.

# How to Run Unit Tests

Pull requests should pass the Ember.js unit tests. Do the following to run these tests.

1. Follow the setup steps listed above under [Building Ember.js](#building-emberjs).

2. To start the development server, run `npm start`.

3. To run all tests, visit <http://localhost:4200/>.

4. To test a specific package, visit `http://localhost:4200/tests/index.html?package=PACKAGE_NAME`. Replace
`PACKAGE_NAME` with the name of the package you want to test. For
example:

  * [Ember.js Runtime](http://localhost:4200/tests/index.html?package=ember-runtime)
  * [Ember.js Views](http://localhost:4200/tests/index.html?package=ember-views)
  * [Ember.js Handlebars](http://localhost:4200/tests/index.html?package=ember-handlebars)

To test multiple packages, you can separate them with commas.

You can also pass `jquery=VERSION` in the test URL to test different
versions of jQuery.

## From the CLI

1. Install phantomjs from http://phantomjs.org.

2. Run `npm test` to run a basic test suite or run `TEST_SUITE=all npm test` to
   run a more comprehensive suite.

## From ember-cli

1. `ember test --server`
2. connect the browsers you want
3. if phantom didn't connect automatically, you can run `./bin/connect-phantom-to <optional-port>`

To run a specific browser, you can use the `--launch` flag

* `ember test --server --launch SL_Firefox_Current`
* `ember test --launch SL_Firefox_Current`
